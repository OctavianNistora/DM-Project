Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,Talking Tech and AI with Tim Cook!,pMX2cQdPubk,2024-06-12T15:56:11Z,PT16M33S,2105038,102368,7373,"['Tim Cook', 'Tim Cook Interview', 'Apple Intelligence', 'mkbhd', 'MKBHD', 'Talking tech with Tim Cook', 'talking tech', 'Tim Cook AI', 'Apple CEO']"," Alright Tim, great to see you. Thanks for spending the time. Thank you for coming. So you had the WWDC keynote today. Yeah. It was really fun to watch it was a whole two hours. I want to zoom all the way out because obviously a lot of talk about AI in general. Yeah. And I'm kind of just left wondering how Apple defines AI in general. Because I know if you ask a regular person, you might hear about generative AI chatbots, things like that. Yeah. And these are relatively new additions to Apple's AI portfolio. How do you look at AI as Apple? Well, we've been executing with AI for a long time. Right. It's that you're wearing a watch. It's at the root of the watch. I mean, you think about things like crash detection, fall detection, things like a fib and all of this kind of stuff is machine learning at the end of the day. And so, but what has captured people's imagination is generative AI. And we see it as the opportunity for a whole new curve of technology and and providing and doing more things for people, providing an assistant for people, things that really improve people's lives. So that's how we see it. There's obviously it's not without downside. And so we approach it very thoughtfully. And as you heard, we have always been focused on privacy. And so privacy is a very key tenant of our thrust in AI. Right. It's interesting to watch Apple's arc with AI because I made a whole piece not more than about a year ago about how Apple seems to never say AI. You know, I have all these neural engines, the machine learning and things like that. And and so now we have almost this pivot where now we're just saying it. We're actually branding it. Apple intelligence now. I'm curious why that change now. Well, in the beginning and throughout almost everything that we always do, we always talk about the benefit to the user. And so the benefit to the user is crash detection and fall detection, not the technology behind the feature. And so we still we still view it like that. But it became clear that people wanted to know our views on on generative AI in particular. And so we decided to embrace it and I called it Apple intelligence. Okay. I have a quote from the duolipian review that you did. Oh, okay. It's great. It was fun. She's fantastic. I was I loved it. It was great. I you had a quote that said about AI if it can be used for nefarious things, we won't go down that road. Yeah. And at the time, I assumed that that meant generative AI was off the table because of all the things that we'd seen about what it was potentially capable of or things that it might do. Has that changed? Is that something that was off the table and you figure now you've got the right tools or the right restrictions to make sure that that all goes super well? How do you think about that? Generative AI was never off the table. It was always about pursuing it in a thoughtful kind of way. And so that that's what we've done and we've implemented it in ways that are less likely to create issues. How so? How so? Well, things that if you think about the kinds of things that we talked about, we talked about personal context and we talked about privacy. And so we're not waiting for a comprehensive privacy legislation regulation to come into effect. We're we already view privacy as a fundamental human right. And so that's the way we that's the lens that we see it at. And given that we're doing those things, personal context and privacy, we wanted to integrate it at a deep level. So you're not having to think, oh well now I want to do something that uses intelligence. We put it in the apps that you're already using and integrated it deeply. Right. Yeah, I think also now there's a lot of talk about it now that there is generative AI. Yeah. A lot of people have, I mean, Apple's notorious for never sending anything to the cloud. Everything's on device because that is the most secure way to do it and was applauded for it. Interestingly, this is a little bit different now with a lot of these larger models, more complex requests. You actually do have to go off the device. So you've developed, I want to get the name right. Prior to cloud compute. Explain this to us because I think the general chatter online is well, they have to be sending data to open AI, for example, to get a request back from chat GPT. Well, there's private cloud compute and then there's the arrangement with open AI. These two things are different. Okay. And so if you look at private cloud compute, we're utilizing the same silicon, not the same silicon, but the same basic architecture as the silicon that's in, well, that's in the iPhone. And we're using the same software. And so we believe that we've done it in such a way that it's as safe and secure and private in the private cloud compute as the device. And so we've really worked on this a lot and put a lot of wood behind that arrow to assure that. If you're working on something that requires world knowledge, so you're out of the domain of personal context and so forth, then you may want to go and use one of the large language models that are on the market. And we selected what we fill is the best one with open AI and chat GPT. But you'll make a conscious decision to do that every time. So you can guarantee that there will never be any data sent to open AI without your explicit user. That's right. That's right. You decide. Right. I also feel like there is this blip on the radar of standalone AI devices, which I found really interesting. They didn't land too well. I think smartphones are pretty great. But there wasn't an interesting conversation around that about using your phone less. Maybe having AI help you out in ways that let you spend less time on the screen. And this is something you echoed also in the duality for interview. Like if you're looking at your phone, more than you're looking at a so-and-else size, something's off there. Yeah. Do you think there's a potential future where we're using our phones less because of how well the intelligence works? I think it's a possibility and a significant possibility. I mean, for us, we've never been motivated for people to spend their lives on their devices. Our model is not one that needs engagement to succeed. Our model is one that where we want to empower you to be able to do things you couldn't do otherwise. We want to give you a tool so you can do incredible things that you couldn't do without the tool. That's what motivates us. And so we come out with things like screen time, etc. So it's a bit in your face as to how much you're using your device. We come out with we counter notifications and so forth so that you can go in and say, do I really want this many notifications? And we have focus kinds of states where you can silence the phone, etc. And so I do believe that as things get smarter and smarter with Apple Intelligence that you can even take the things that we're taking more time will take less time now. And so I do think that opportunity exists. Interesting. Yeah, it's a curious future. It is. It is. And I think I'm really optimistic about it. Yeah. I also feel like those tons of chatter. When you were first CEO of Apple about this new shift obviously coming from Steve Jobs and you've been CEO for feels like a long time now. And we're entering this new age of AI. And I'm curious now. Now there's a new chatter about who's next CEO is going to be. What do you feel like your your legacy as CEO at Apple should be? Yeah, Mark, I don't think about it. And so to to me, a legacy is something that is defined by other people looking at you. Not something that you define yourself. Very fair. And and so I and I typically I'm always focused on the forward. Not the rear view mirror. And that's that is a characteristic of Apple in general is we're very focused on the forward. You you won't find a museum here. And yet we would have lots of things that you might like to see and and reminisce about. But we just don't it's just not a part of our culture. Yeah. And and so I feel the same way personally. At some point there will be another CEO. And and and my whole focus in life will will be on making them successful. Yeah. I like that. That's it. It's very LeBron answer. Like you saw. Yeah. All right. I want to end with a little game. I don't know if you've seen these where sublime ranking. Have you seen with either a blind rank. So we're going to do a top five Apple products of all time. But I'm going to give you them one at a time and you don't know what the rest of them are. So you have to rank the first one without knowing what two three four and five are. Oh, and this is your ranking. This will be your unofficial ranking just based on your gut reaction of how you feel about this. This is a top win because it is a tough one. It's like asking you your favorite kids or nephews or nieces. We'll see how it goes. Yeah. Okay. Number one MacBook air. But I had that iconic moment of like taking it out the envelope on stage. It's the most popular laptop in the world, I think. It's the most popular in the world. And that moment of taking it out of the folder. Established a characteristic about that device that lives today. The first one, it wasn't about how many people would buy it. Yeah. It was about establishing the foundation. Was that the first air that was that was of any line? Yeah. You might have. I believe so. Yeah. Okay. I believe so. And so I'm going to fail miserably at giving you a ranking. But it was a huge moment. Yeah. A huge moment for the company. The iPad. Oh, wow. You know, tablets had been in the market for a long time. Mm-hmm. Well, our objective is never to be first. Our objective is to be best. I remember all the rumors leading up to it. And there were many rumors relating up to it and people thought many things that weren't too nice about it in the beginning, including the name. And yet, I couldn't live without my iPad today. Yeah. And so another huge moment for the company. My number three is the Magic Mouse. The Magic Mouse. It was also an incredible moment. People don't think of that as much as they would the MacBook Air and the iPad and whatever else you're going to name, probably. But the getting the ergonomics well done and was key. With Magic Mouse. Yeah. Okay. 4 out of 5. The iPhone. Oh my god. It changed the world. It definitely changed the world. It changed the world. And the simplicity of defining the three things that were on the phone was brilliant. To get people to think about it like that. And of course, opening up, this isn't talked about as much. But initially, you'll remember that there was not an App Store. The App Store came a year later. And that changed everything in the developer community. Because now I meet with students every WWDC. And they give me such great inspiration. There were no students in the developer community at that particular point in time. Now, the developer population is very diverse from an age point of view and everything else. And it just fundamentally became an economic miracle for people. And got well outside of just doing it for a hobby. It was, you look at all the businesses that came out of it. Yeah. And now WWDC. That's right. Last but not least, Vision Pro. Oh, I love Vision Pro. I was just using it last night to look at the screening. Yeah. What do you use Vision Pro for? I ask everybody who has one. I use it for the entertainment value. I use it when I want to do multitasking because I find the multiple windows really effective in doing this. Of course, I'm reviewing lots of apps on it right now. And some of those are enterprise apps, some people's proprietary apps that they want to share with us. And I'm seeing an extraordinary number and variety of things coming out of the enterprise area far earlier than we would have predicted. Because businesses generally move slow to adopt. Yeah. And what we're seeing is that half of the Fortune 100 is now buying Vision Pro for some project or the other or exploring it. And so I'm looking at several of those. And yeah, I find that it's still an emotional experience to look at your photos. And with Vision OS 2, being able to take your old photos and make them 3D, I think is a big, big thing. And I lost both of my parents and before Vision Pro came out. And being able to go back and look at those photos differently is something that you know, it's an experience you can't replicate. Sure. Well, we didn't get a blind ranking, but we got a pretty good retrospective of some of these products. Thanks again. Thank you. I'm looking forward to the next feature drops in the next dub dub. But this was fun. Thank you. Yeah, it was great fun. Thank you for coming. Thanks, Ram."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,WWDC 2024 Recap: Is Apple Intelligence Legit?,qkYoBNdcXBU,2024-06-11T07:28:19Z,PT18M23S,4985555,198283,11892,"['WWDC', 'WWDC 2024', 'Apple Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'AI', 'MKBHD', 'Apple AI', 'iOS 18', 'iPadOS 18']"," So we just got done with possibly one of the biggest Apple WDC keynotes of all time, maybe just because of the state of the world and what everyone expects from tech companies in 2024, which is AI at the front of what you do. Interestingly, with Apple this time, Apple had AI at the back half of what they did. Literally the entire first half of the keynote, they didn't say AI once, zero times. And the second hour, they basically just went, all right, yeah, we actually do have a lot of AI stuff to share with you. And they just spit it all out. And of course they did manage to brand it because of course they did. AI for them is now Apple intelligence. But look, I watched and live tweeted the entire two hour long keynote so you don't have to. And I've gathered all my thoughts and all the most important announcements. So this is everything you need to know that's new and some of my takes on it. So I'm going to go in the same order that Apple went. I'm going to start with Vision OS and we're already on somehow Vision OS 2.0 less than half a year after the Vision Pro first got announced. And there are some solid new features, but I don't know if I would call this 2.0 worthy. It feels more like a 1.2 update, but okay, whatever. We'll go with it. So there's a new wrist turn gesture to quickly see the time and your battery percentage. And then you can jump right from there into the control center instead of having to like look way up at the ceiling like you had to before every time. Kind of reminds me of the Oculus Quest. That is easy. That's an upgrade. There's a bunch of immersive media features like they let you go through your old photos and use advanced machine learning to turn them into spatial photos, which is really interesting if it works. And there are also new tools to help people create spatial videos and immersive videos on cameras other than the iPhone. But then of course you can only view them on a Vision Pro. So who knows how valuable this will actually turn out to be. But then this year, Mac mirroring will get way more resolution thanks to it now doing the foviated rendering on the Mac. So basically it frees up a ton of resources and it lets you do up to double the resolution. So you could do a gigantic ultra wide if you want it to be. That is way more room for windows and activities. Love that. And that's pretty much it. Again, it's not the biggest 2.0 update we've ever seen, but it does feel like there's some nice updates in there, including some new environments and the ability to rearrange your home screen. Believe it or not, you couldn't do that before. Now you can. But speaking of rearranging your home screen, iOS just got one of the biggest or at least most interesting updates in a long time. And I'm just going to, if you're an Android user, I'd say for the next like two minutes, three minutes, just go ahead and unplug your keyboard for a second and just relax because yes, we've had these features for a long time. But now it's the iPhone's time to shine. All right. You will finally be able to put icons wherever you want on the iOS 18 home screen grid. And it was hilarious that this got a whole applause moment from the audience during the key note as if they just invented a new feature. But fine, you've been waiting for a long time for this. Have your fun. But they didn't stop there. They added a whole bunch of other customization features to the iPhone home screen too. And it started to get a little more interesting. See, there's this new theme engine now that lets you go in and change the color of every icon and widget on your home screen to the same color. So you can really, you can match your wallpaper with your icons to frame it nicely and have matching colors everywhere. It's a simple thing. And we've been doing it on Android with launchers for years. But the thing about these is before this moment, basically every iPhone home screen looked the same. We've been saying that. You've just given you the ability to go crazy and kind of ruin your home screen if you want to. And people seem to absolutely want to. I have seen some rough home screens people are making on Twitter. A lot of them just look terrible. And I think the main thing I noticed is it seems like there are apps that support this whole colored thing well. And then there are apps that don't that just looks like it tints the entire, it literally applies a color cast to the entire icon on your home screen, which causes all kinds of legibility problems. It doesn't look good. There are widgets that look horrible, that it's just unreadable. So yeah, you can make some, some pretty looking home screens if you want, but you can also make some really ugly looking home screens. Now I was trying to decide if I like this more or less than what Google did on the pixels with material you. I think technically, technically it's better because it works on all of the icons. I don't know how many setups I've tried where I wanted to do the monochrome icons. But there are just a few of my apps that aren't supported. So they end up looking kind of like they stick out like a sore thumb. So at least Apple's is letting you change all the icons at once. But anyway, Apple's also redesigned the control center to be fully customizable across multiple pages. So again, there's a lot more going on here. And there are many more customizable shortcuts in more places, including finally replacing the flashlight and camera on the home screen with how gel breaking. Finally, and the list keeps going. If you've heard these before, but there are, you can do hidden apps now inside your app drawer. So you can lock apps into a hidden folder that makes it easier than ever to hide Tinder from your wife. There's also scheduled text messages and I message. Great. Finally, they're having some fun over there. There's also text formatting. There's messages via satellite. RCS support was very casually, but briefly mentioned. The photos app is redesigned. There's also a game mode that now minimizes background activity and minimizes Bluetooth latency for peripherals. Great. And a new automatic categorization in the new mail app. So you can tell there's been a whole bunch of stuff. I will definitely be doing a larger, more focused, just iOS 18 video. So you can see everything that's new. There's plenty of little stuff that didn't make it into the keynote. So I'll do a whole deep dive just for that. Make sure you subscribe to be among the first to see that. I believe we are catching up to Apple and subscribers. Be kind of nice if we pass them. I'll be sick. So then AirPods got minor updates like voice isolation during phone calls, spatial audio during games, and the ability to respond to a prompt just by nodding or shaking your head. Taken right from the Sony headphones, I kind of like it though controlling it without using your voice is nice. Then Apple TV gets this new feature where you swipe down on the remote at any point during a show and it just shows you all the actors and character names of the people on the screen and any song that's playing in that moment in real time. And there's also a feature that boosts people's voices so you can always hear them over the music. And then watch OS. They got this little training mode that sort of balances the trends in your training over time and evaluates how hard a workout was versus how hard it could have been. And then iPad OS. So this was supposed to be Apple's big chance to really convince us that the iPad is it's something special that's got a little something to it that would make us convince that we'd want to get the newest one, the M4 one that just came out over just your phone or over a Mac. And I'll say it did get one incredible feature, but it didn't really do much more than that. So the iPad, you know, gets all the stuff I talked about with the iPhone, right? Full home screen customization, customizable control center, the new photos app, etc. That's all great. There's also a feature in SharePlay that lets you go in and actually remotely control someone's iPad when they allow it, which seems like a small thing, but I promise you that is massive for family tech support. You know who you are. But the one massive, actually impressive new feature on the iPad in iPad OS 18 and you think I'm joking, but I'm dead serious when I say this. It's the calculator app. It's the new calculator. I promise you I was so ready to dunk on this. Like I had a tweet like drafted up as they were talking about it. We finally brought the calculator to the iPad and there was screenshots of it and it looked just like the iPhone app and I was like, really? This is this is what you were so hyped about. I had that clip cute up ready of Craig Federeriki being like, yes, we had to do something super special to finally bring the calculator to the iPad. But then then they pulled the Apple pencil off the side and they pulled up what's called math notes. And it was pretty sick. Now on the iPad, you can actually write down equations in handwriting and it will understand what you wrote and it will answer the question in your handwriting. And then if you adjust the equation or add new information or something, it automatically updates the answer, which was so sick. I don't know why I'm so impressed with this, but it was really cool to play with and look at. So if that wasn't impressive enough, it also supports variables. So you can have variables written all over the page. So look at this. It has G and X and A and H and then it's a labeled Y as the height here. So you can ask for an equation using these variables and it can give you an answer. And if you want, you can do a Y equals equation and it'll give you a graph with real time adjustment of any of the variables in your equation. I mean, I wish I was in sixth grade again. So this could be my full time calculator. This is sick. Even in the keynote, they haven't even actually said the word like AI a single time yet. I think this is pretty clearly AI. This is like handwriting recognition. This is like semantic understanding of all the things happening on the page. It's good AI. Well played, Craig, you did it. Okay, but this is before the actual AI section. But also this wasn't mentioned on stage, but this is also coming to the iPhones calculator app as well. But then MacOS. MacOS has its newest version. It's called Sequoia and it does also get a nice little grab bag of new features. There's automatic window snapping now. Finally built in. You don't need a third party app to do it anymore. Sure locked. There's built in backgrounds for any app that uses the webcam feed. There's also a new password app that basically just takes what was buried in the settings before and just makes it its own standalone app. So it's actually on Mac, iPad and iPhone. But probably the biggest thing is iPhone mirroring. So this is another continuity feature that basically just lets you wirelessly always see your iPhone on your Mac. It merges your notifications and audio with your Macs and lets you drag and drop things back and forth between your phone that's saying next to you and your Mac. I kind of wonder if this hits your phone battery. Harder than normal. They didn't really say obviously so I'm going to have to test this. But I imagine if you're just sitting on a wireless charger then it won't matter. But I'll be checking that out. But then we arrived. They did all the sections with all the other operating systems and now we got to the part where Apple is going to talk about AI stuff. Kind of. Now I don't know if you remember this but a couple months ago, not that long ago, I didn't entire video on all of these phrases that it seems like Apple refused to say on stage. They just would not say them. And AI is one of them. They just didn't say it. They'd say anything else. Neural nets, machine learning, all sorts of other things like that. But the times of the times people want to hear Apple talk about AI. So they finally did. And they also, like I said, they rebranded it just for themselves just to just come a dear of the AI name. And so now it's called Apple Intelligence in Apple Lamp. So here's basically what you need to know about Apple Intelligence, right? So Apple has already had AI features on their devices before. They've had the neural engine inside of their chips and they've done things like, you know, smartly cutting subject side of photos. They've done things like autocomplete on the keyboard. That's already existed. But this new Apple Intelligence is basically a bucket of these new generative models and what they do on your devices. So there's these new diffusion models, generative models and large language models that are all built by Apple that bring new functionality to the supported devices. And actually, I'll just get that out the way right off the bat. These are only supported on the highest end versions of currently available Apple Silicon. So that just means iPhone 15 pro and any iPad with M1 or later and any Mac with M1 or later. So what does that look like? Well, basically starting with these new OSs, there's a small suite of tools that's kind of sprinkled across everything. It's not like there's one Apple Intelligence app or something like that. They're just kind of sprinkled throughout. So here's an example, writing tools. You know, we all know how powerful these large language models can be. So anytime you're writing in, you know, pages or keynote or basically anywhere where there's a cursor, you can use the writing tools to summarize or rewrite something that you've already written. It can change the writing style or just proofread just basic useful stuff. Here's another one. Remember the Magic Eraser tool in Google Photos and these Android phones that use it? Apple's finally doing that too. Builds into their own photos app is a cleanup tool. And it's basically the same idea. This will identify background items. It'll let you circle items you don't like in your photos and just get rid of them, fill in the background with generative fill super quick. And there's also Gen Mojis, generative emojis. And this may feel really old because I would never use this, but apparently there's a whole group of people who go through searching for emojis and then they find that there's one that doesn't exist and they're like, dang, I wish I could just make an emoji for this moment right now. For those people, yeah, now you can. You can generate a new emoji. You can literally type it in like a prompt and the diffusion model will create that new emoji from scratch in the style of all the other emojis. And they had an entire thing called the image playground that's built into a bunch of Apple's apps, but also has its own separate app that lets you create these nice little square images with prompts in three different styles, sketch, illustration and animation. And yes, there are also Siri improvements that's using the large language models to generally understand context better and just generally be better and more natural at being an assistant that isn't garbage. And later in the year, it will also be able to pull info from inside of apps and take actions inside of apps for you too. I remember when this was like a huge bixby feature on Samsung phones. So that's cool to see. Plus there's also this like big, pretty new full screen animation when you're triggering Siri to tie it all together. Its voice is apparently slightly updated and you can now also type to Siri instead of talking to it out loud every time, which is long overdue, but also nice. There is notes app summaries, there is phone call summaries, all kinds of features sprinkled around. Like I said, definitely I want to, I think I'll end up making a video just summarizing or testing or reviewing all of the Apple intelligence stuff because it's kind of all over the place. But now you know what it is. But one question that's been floating around the internet is what stuff is happening on device versus things that have to go to the cloud. And this has also come up a lot because you might have also heard about Apple partnering specifically with open AI to integrate chat GPT 4.0 into this Apple intelligence stuff. So it's a big question everyone's wondering. So I got the official answers from Apple. And the answer is basically almost everything happens on device intentionally and those are from Apple built models. So that should be the fastest stuff that happens. But in the chance that there are things that are too complex or just outside of the area of expertise of Apple's models, then it can basically go one of two ways. One is it will go to a larger server based model that's on servers that Apple has built with Apple Silicon using what they call private cloud compute. So basically the info is never stored or sent to Apple. It's still going to have the downsides of having to go off of the device up to the cloud. It might take a bit longer if you're in an area with terrible internet. It might not work at all. But in the chance that this is like a big complex thing that could benefit from those models, that's what it'll try to do. But the other is when you specifically ask it for something that chat GPT would be good at. And that happens then it will specifically ask you, hey, is it cool if I ask chat GPT for an answer to this question? And then you can give it a yes or no on the spot. So anytime it wants to do this, whether it's to upload a photo that you're asking something about or just a complex prompt in general, then this little dialog box pops up and you have to say yes every time. And then you can tap into everything that open AI's model is capable of or generate even more realistic or varied random different styles of images that Apple's diffusion models would never make. This is all free without an account. At no point is open AI allowed to ever store any of these requests. And Apple has also said that they will obscure your IP address. So you can't even open AI, can't even connect multiple requests together to form a profile of you. There's just a lot of thought that's gone into ideally making this as secure and private of a version of going to the cloud for AI features as they possibly can. So yeah, it's really interesting. A lot of interesting stuff going on here. I think my overall take with a lot of this WDC announcements and with the Apple intelligence stuff is that first of all is that like the humane pin and the rabbit are one. They were so doomed from the start. Like there's no, even if they were good up to this point, there's just no way they could be as good as this stuff on your phone with all the personalization, all the info that they already know about you. So I guess that's confirmed. But also it just kind of, it does feel like we've entered a new age with Apple. I think if the AI stuff is so important that it very much is what we're most interested in in an overshadows, like honestly, what could possibly be your favorite non AI feature from the past couple of things? Having home screen apps and icons everywhere, like that might be the biggest thing, but it's up to this point now all about what this intelligent stuff can actually do for you and what it can bring you. So that's what I'm really excited about. I'll be working on some videos very soon about a lot of this stuff. So definitely like I said, get subscribed if you haven't already, but this has been your overview of what you need to know. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,I Visited Apple's Secret iPhone Testing Labs!,8reaJG7z-is,2024-06-07T21:31:09Z,PT10M52S,2676804,119174,6225,," So a couple days ago I dropped a Twitter thread. Yes, I still call it Twitter. And I severely underestimated how many of you guys would be interested in it. But then a lot of the conversation that I drove was really interesting and a lot of discussions that happened afterward. We'll fund up our participate in so I figured I would drop even more of a footage here. So I'm back with more of my footage and clips from my visit to Apple's secret iPhone durability testing labs. So if you ever wondered how an iPhone gets water resistance tested or drop tested or shaken like crazy before it gets announced on stage, these are the labs where all of that happens. And then they have to connect the dots between their test results and how they actually build phones, which is fascinating. So the first thing that I saw was the water resistance testing. So I think a lot of us kind of take for granted at this point, most high end smartphones, most flagships have IP68 ratings. But a lot of people don't actually think about it that that is a code where IP stands for English protection. And then the first number is for solids. And then the second number is for liquids. And so each of these numbers gets higher and higher as it's more protected against English. So some like earbuds or headphones, for example, you might see they are IPX4 rated. That just means they're not protected from dust. But from water, they can withstand some light splashes from any direction. So sweat. So the first iPhones all the way up to the iPhone 6s were not water resistant at all, at least not rated to be. But then the first water resistant iPhone, iPhone 7 was IP67 water resistant. And then now we just kind of we see everything being IP68, meaning it can literally be under water for an extended period of time. And so this is what it looks like to actually test that stuff. There's literally specialty equipment just to torture phones with water and make sure they can survive. Lots of companies have these things, but it was cool to see it in person. So the lowest level of this test is basically a drip ceiling to simulate rain and splashing. So there's no real water pressure here, but a pass is good for IPX4 on this test. But then to simulate some water pressure, they have these jets that rotate around the device and spray it with water from all angles into the speakers, into the earpiece, into the ports, everything. And if it's able to pass this test, that's good for IPX5. It seems so simple, but it's also pretty cool to see I've never actually watched this happen. To turn it up to 11, they just put the phone on one end and stick basically a literal fire hose on the other end and just blast the phone with high pressure water. Kind of looks insane, but if we want our modern smartphones to be able to get splashed from any angle many times over its lifetime and survive, then it has to survive this. And then it earns its IPX6 rating. But then finally for IPX7 and IPX8, that's full submersion. So they have some lockable sealed tanks, but some of you may already know that IPX8 is supposed to be under deep water for a long time. So they actually have this pressurized tank where they can turn up the pressure inside to simulate different water depths and leave phones in there as long as they want. So now ideally today if you drop your phone in the toilet or spill water on it or drop it in a lake, whatever, for as long as it's down there, it should survive. Which again, we kind of take it for granted, but that's all the seals and the gas gets another the adhesives and things that go into getting it to pass those tests are what get it to pass the real world tests. Now there is an entire separate type of testing that you might have already seen on YouTube that is drop testing. And it turns out Apple has been doing their own internal drop testing for years now. So it turns out in the same building, Apple set up this full on industrial robot by Epson that they've programmed to be a drop test robot. And then they've set it up in front of these ultra bright lights and super high speed phantom cameras pointed at the exact spot on the ground where the phone will land. So the idea here is they can program the robot to pick up the phone and drop it onto any surface. And then they can have it repeat that exact motion and that exact same drop on the exact same angle over and over again, but with different surfaces and they can A, B test them and take a look at exactly what happened. And then those of you who are camera nerds, you already know these phantom cameras are pretty serious. I don't remember the exact frame rate they told me they were shooting at, but it's pretty incredible. You can actually see the titanium on this iPhone 15 Pro wobble on its first impact with the ground. And it's second impact too. So yeah, they had all kinds of different materials to do drop tests from granite countertops, to marble, to corkboard and wood, etc. They even had this massive block of asphalt just sitting there, just waiting to see how the iPhone reacts to being dropped in the streets, you know. But this is a fascinating setup. Now of course, the fact is most phones still just break immediately when you drop them on the ground. So I kind of wonder how much of this data is actually getting translated into real changes of phone design. But it's still cool that I got to see all this stuff. And then the hardest one to capture for me anyway is the shaking tests. Yeah, it's exactly what it sounds like. Shaking tests. Apple has rooms full of machines that are literally trays of devices strapped to a surface that's being shaken thousands of times at a specific frequency. It's actually kind of hard to record because if my shutter speed is at the right number, it doesn't even really look like anything's moving, kind of like how car wheels don't look like they're spinning if you have the right camera settings. But I'd dig it a few clips where like I put my hand on it and you can see it's moving a lot. They're using this machine to try to simulate years of wear and tear out in the real world. Apparently they can program in the frequency of a certain motorcycle engine or car engine or subway car or whatever constant vibration that they just want to check up on to make sure everything holds up to exposure to it over a very long time. But I really think the most fascinating thing about all this testing is they are trying before the phone even comes out. They're trying to simulate years of wear and tear in the real world with real customers in a small room under the basement of Apple Park with like the machines that they've designed. It's a fascinating connection they've got to make. And I spoke to John Ternis who's the head of hardware engineering and Apple about this process. And he mentioned apparently they go through sometimes 10,000 iPhones prototypes before they actually ship a final phone with all this durability testing. Which sounds crazy. I don't know what number I thought it was in my head, but it seems insane that they'll make 10,000 phones to break before they ship one. And actually while I had John there, I felt like this was a unique opportunity to ask because I've never really heard people from Apple actually speak out about the durability but also the repairability of the iPhone. Like we all know Apple's reputation for a parability. Not great. Like the iPhone is notoriously very difficult to repair. But also now it's a little clearer because the more I've thought about it, the more it feels like, I mean Apple's just shown me a ton of durability labs. And durability feels like it's directly at odds with repairability. Like it actually feels like it's basically a sliding scale with durability on one side and repairability on the other. And the more durable you want to make your thing, the less repairable you're making your thing. And all these decisions that go into making and designing a product are kind of pushing it back and forth along this scale. So take a listen to this. But sometimes for me I find it helpful to kind of think about the book and so like if you imagine a product that never fails, right, that just doesn't fail. Yep. And on the other end of product that maybe isn't very reliable, but it's super easy to repair. Right. The product that never fails is obviously better for the customer. It's better for the environment. Okay. It's interesting you put it that way because on one end you have the product that never fails. On the other hand, you have the product that can be replaced infinitely, but it's not as reliable. Yep. That downside of being not as reliable comes from being infinitely repairable. But I think someone argued that the downside of being really hard to repair comes from being almost infinitely durable. Sure, but they're not always mutually exclusive. Like those are kind of the bookends. So let me give you like a couple of examples. Yeah. I think of battery on a on an iPhone as being an important one. On an iPhone on any phone, a battery is something that you want to extend the life of the product. That's something that's going to need to be replaced, right? Battery's battery for out. But as we've been making iPhones for a long time, in the early days, one of the most common types of failures was water ingress, right, where you drop it in the pool, you know, spill your drink on it and the unit fails. And so we've been making strides over all those years to get better and better and better in terms of minimizing those failures and on how many years it's been now. But we got to a point of IP68, which is kind of a rating for water ingress, which is really impressive. And I think you get to see some of these tests, right? And it's great because we get these stories of people, you know, literally I dropped my phone in the lake. I couldn't get it for two weeks. I fished it out. It still works. They're super excited. That said, to get the product there, you've got to design a lot of seals, adhesives, other things to make it perform that way, which makes it a little harder to do that battery repair. You still need to do the battery repair. So we need to make sure we have solution for customers to do that, which we do. But it's objectively better for the customer to have that reliability. And it's ultimately better for the planet because the failure rate since we got to that point have just dropped. It's plummeted, right? So there's a number of repairs that need to happen. And every time you do a repair, you're bringing in new materials to replace whatever pro. So you can actually do the math and figure out there's a threshold at which if I can make it this durable, then it's better to have it a little bit harder to repair because it's going to net out. So yeah, that checks out. I found that kind of interesting. We've never really heard anyone from Apple speak directly about this. Now of course, in a dream world of Apple's goal is to make the ultimate phone that never, breaks, then they probably shouldn't be making it from glass because in the words of Jerry Rigg, everything, glass is glass, glass breaks. But still, they're trying to push as far towards that end as possible. And it is interesting to hear a little bit of the behind the scenes on the philosophy there. But yeah, that's been it. That's my behind the scenes look at Apple's durability testing labs that we've never seen before. Make sure you subscribe to see more stuff, very cool like this coming up soon. And let me know what you think about this sliding scale of durability versus repair. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,Sonos Ace Headphones: You Had One Job!,6_3cLlSlTKw,2024-06-03T14:57:33Z,PT11M23S,2322170,77884,4194,"['Sonos Ace', 'Sonos headphones', 'Sonos', 'MKBHD', 'review', 'Sonos Ace review', 'Sonos Ace headphones', 'Sonos headphones vs', 'Sonos vs', 'Sonos vs Sony', 'Sonos vs Bose', 'Sonos vs AirPods Max', 'Sonos Ace vs AirPods']"," Alright, so the world of high-end noise-canceling headphones has kind of settled over the last few years. You know, you've got the sonies, you've got the bows, there's the AirPods Max, and then kind of the rest. But now, Player 4 has entered the game. Sonos. So you've probably heard of Sonos. They've been making these premium sound bars for years. That's been their most popular product. And everyone just kind of figured they would eventually get into headphones. It was just a matter of when and how much. Because that's the thing about Sonos speakers is they are premium. They're very expensive. And so now here, it's obviously interesting enough that it's a new player, but they're also now expensive. $450 Bluetooth Noise Canceling Headphones. So at that price, the question is, are they actually worth getting? So I've been using the Sonos Ace headphones for more than a month now. I've edited videos with them. I've listened to a lot of music. I've gone on flights. And turns out, they're really solid. And they do have some really nice features. But they're also definitely some downsides. And there's really only a small group of people that I would actually recommend these to. But let me just start with the basics. Right? So these are the headphones. They are mostly made of plastic, and that is totally normal in this price range. Because that makes them super lightweight and comfortable. And that is one of these headphones best assets for sure. So they're really flexible for different head sizes and shapes. And the top headband is really soft. The ear cups are also removable. And they snap on and off with magnets. And they're also really soft. So ideally, you can replace these ear cups when they get old. And by the way, I like that they have a different color mesh for the right and left side. So you can tell out a glance which one is which. Also same with the black colored version. That's kind of a neat touch. The shape of these cups is normal. And they're so soft. But I feel like the one thing I want is for these ear cups to be a bit more. Deep. I mean, when they are on my ears, they're fine. But they're just a little bit shallow. And my ears like touching the inside of it. So that's maybe my only fit complaint. But everything else about the way they like wears great. I think aesthetically they look like a combo between the sonies and the Microsoft surface headphones. I don't know if you remember those, but they had that matte off white look. And then with the frictionless stainless steel bands that AirPods Max have, that kind of completes the look. Overall pretty simple though. Not too much branding, not too many crazy accent pieces, just good looking and good feeling headphones. Here's where I start to have complaints though. So this is the case that it comes with. Pretty simple design. It's like this recycled material. And it's got a different color inside versus outside. But this zipper right here is so not. It's just maybe nitpicking. But how often it gets snagged on the way opening or closing it is very annoying. So I wish it was either thicker or just smoother. And then the headphones do not fold down at all to fit inside. And matter of fact, if you have them extended, they still don't fit inside the case. So you have to fully collapse them and then just place them in there. So they don't really pack down very small, unfortunately. There is also a little floating pouch thing here in the middle of the case for cables that like magnetizes in, which is pretty clever. Aside from that though, for as premium as these headphones are, I just feel like the case doesn't really match up for $450. I just got to be honest, I wish the case was better. But then buttons. Good to see real buttons. So on the left ear cup, there's just one button. That's a real power button. So you hold that for three seconds to turn it on or off. Or hold seven seconds to pair. Then on the right side is a button and a switch. So the button is basically the switch between noise cancellation and transparency mode. Then up top is this kind of a rocker switch slash button. It's called the content key because it controls all your media. But you slide it up or down to change volume and then you can press to play pause or double press to go forward. So basically that rocker controls everything. I think in general, Sonos got most of the fundamentals right with these headphones as far as design goes. Thankfully, like nothing critically wrong with them. They're pretty minimal. It's got the smooth, stepless adjustment. These are some of the lightest, softest, especially headphones I've ever worn. I think with deeper ear cups, they're probably an A-plus. They have a rock solid 40 plus hour battery life. They have multi-point Bluetooth connectivity so you can connect them to two different Bluetooth devices at once. So we might as well just get right into how they sound. So these are closed back active noise cancellation over ear headphones. They have custom 40 millimeter drivers and eight microphones positioned all the way around for noise cancellation. And the pastor mode. I do think these headphones sound good. Now they are not mind blowing, world beating or anything crazy like that. They are still constrained by physics and Bluetooth codecs. But they have a nice full sound with great bass all the way through strong highs. At first, I thought they sounded a little mudier than AirPods Max. But you can brighten them right up by jumping in the EQ settings in the extremely neutered Sonos app. And that's where you can mess with just a couple other very basic things like on-head detection and head tracking surround. But like, yeah, look, the EQ is literally just a bass slider and a treble slider. So I hope they add to this at some point, but at least you can change that. The most impressive thing really about their sound I think is the noise cancellation. It is really, really good. It basically erases any sort of white noise air conditioning, droning road noise. Like they are incredible for airplanes. And they can absorb even some of the more sudden noise changes as well. I think this is a plus noise cancellation in my book. And then to my surprise, they also have some of the best transparency mode I've heard in anything that's not AirPods. Really natural sounding for having regular conversations with your headphones on. You can hear the environment around you. They call it a wear mode. This is also great. So I've been saying all these nice things. They clearly, they sound good. They look good. They have all these good features. Good noise cancellation. They're very comfortable. So what's with the title? So here's the thing. The reason everyone was waiting for Sonos to do headphones is because Sonos already makes these awesome speakers. They have a reputation with these internet connected speaker systems that are a hit. Like I have a Sonos arc at home and it sounds great. It's awesome. I think aside from what they did to the app, they're fantastic. You connect to various music slash media sources and you can stream them to the speaker systems in high quality. You can also obviously connect them to your TV. They're great. And so naturally, I think we'd all like to have a new pair of Sonos headphones that can join right into the ecosystem and connect in the Sonos app to be another one of our sets of Sonos speakers and have all the same functionality. Unfortunately, they can't. These are not Wi-Fi connected headphones. They're just regular. They're Bluetooth headphones. So what you can do is when you're home, you can connect the headphones straight to the speakers. And then you can quickly swap between the arc speaker and the headphones with a single tap of the content button. So when they're connected, you can swap back and forth between watching TV with the speakers and with the headphones pretty seamlessly. But the headphones themselves are not actually Wi-Fi enabled. They're not going to pull anything from any streaming services directly to the headphones like some Sonos speaker systems might. So that's the bummer. And honestly, I think it's probably a battery issue why they aren't able to pull it off on these. And this all might not even be a big deal to almost anyone because basically no other pair of headphones has that ability yet. But for a new $450 pair of Sonos headphones, I kind of thought maybe they'd be able to pull it off. But they didn't. Which means they kind of, to me, now feel like almost an overpriced version of the Sonis that already exists. And I'm talking about the Mark IVs, not even the Mark Vs, which kind of felt like almost a little bit of a pointless upgrade. Now actually recently made an upgrade that I was curious if it would actually make a noticeable difference to me or not. I've been using the 8-Sleep Pod 3 for a couple of years now. And I recently upgraded to the Pod 4. And turns out it's actually pretty sick. So the 8-Sleep, it was already really good at sleep tracking with all the sensors and the heart rate monitors and all that fun stuff. But they've redesigned the tech inside it, making it more comfortable. It's also now twice as powerful for cooling and 40% quieter. But maybe my favorite update is there's a little tap area on the side so you can silence or snooze a vibration alarm just by reaching over and tapping right here. Which is pretty sick. But the extra cooling I think is actually making a difference to me. I think a normal good night of sleep for me, I'm getting like high 80s or low 90s as a sleep score. Which I thought was pretty great. And then lately I've gotten a couple hundreds, which I never used to get. But now I feel like I'm getting 100 like once a week, which is unheard of for me. They said the tech behind the Pod 4 has been clinically validated to increase sleep time by up to an hour every night and increase deep sleep by up to two and a half hours a month and reduce wake up time by three hours a month. All these are little gains that really just add up. And unlike the Sonos app, the 8-Sleep app is really good and consistently is getting better over time. And then also with the Pod 4 Ultra, they made this insane adjustable base that can go underneath your mattress. So it can actually adjust it to different sleeping positions. And then you can turn on automatic snorkel detection. So if it detects snoring, it like gently lifts your head up a few degrees to stop it for you. So if you want to check one out, I'll leave a link below. It's 8-Sleep.com slash MKBHD. And then if you use code MKBHD, you get $350 off a Pod 4 Ultra or $200 off a Pod 4. You're welcome. So at the end of the day, let's say you're in the market for some high-end noise-canceling headphones. Right? Obviously, there are some choices. These feel like they're a direct competitor to AirPods Max. Most people who have an iPhone and iPad or a Mac and a bunch of stuff in the ecosystem who still want that seamless experience will probably still go with AirPods Max even though they're more expensive. But what I will say is those are heavier. And I probably wouldn't buy those right now. I think there's got to be a new version of those like right around the corner. Just as a PSA. And then there's the Bose and the Sony's that I mentioned earlier, which are essentially 90% of the same headphones that have a lot of the same benefits, but one to $200 cheaper. So the only way that I feel like I can shoehorn in recommending this pair of Sonos headphones is, I guess, one, if you just really love the brand and got the money and you don't care. Fine. Two is if you want the best transparency mode that isn't AirPods, that's these. But then three is if you switched between watching TV with your speakers and your headphones particularly often. Like I'm not personally that person, but the one use case I feel like I hear all the time is like people who live together, but one of them wants to watch TV while the other doesn't wake up or doesn't hear something like that. So if you're that person and you already have or are about to get the sonos arc sound bar, then in that case, these are a great pair with that just because of that quick seamless switch feature. But that's kind of it. Otherwise, they're just a normal solid pair of Bluetooth headphones. So I'll leave links to all my other headphone reviews below. Check them out. Get subscribed if you haven't already. Thanks for watching and I'll catch you guys in the next one. Peace."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,Android 15 Hands-On: Top 5 Features!,kkX8_nbBqBQ,2024-05-28T21:40:15Z,PT11M26S,2852481,113474,6558,"['Android 15', 'Android 15 features', 'Android 15 review', 'MKBHD']"," Hey, what's up? I'm Kebih Hd here. And I've got the latest beta of Android 15 on my pixel 8 pro right here. So, why do you know I've done these videos for a long time. Like, I've made a video on the best features of the latest version of Android for, I don't know how many years in a row now since there were name and em after desserts. And if you've been watching all of these, then you've noticed a trend, which is there used to be huge new features and massive like visual overholes and all sorts of crazy gigantic things changing with Android. But now things have stabilized, I would say. It's a lot more small changes and more nuanced things here and there. So it's gotten to the point where these top five features of Android 15 back in the day, this would have been like a .0.2 update. Like this, these are smaller and smaller new features of each new version. But on the other hand, that actually feels like it is there are a little more well considered. They're more about usefulness, they're more about little tweaks here and there to make actually using and owning your phone a little bit better. So I can appreciate that. And I will also say it's felt like in videos in the past, I've said that, you know, this is a version that's only going to show up on the pixel for at least a year and you may never get to see the newest version of Android. But I feel like with a lot of the newest companies actually promising a good amount of software updates into the future. Hopefully more people will actually see these couple of things. So I'm just going to jump right in. These are the top five best features I found in Android 15. So number five is called private space and it's, it's exactly what it sounds like. It's a private space on your Android phone for your top secret files, photos and whatever else you got in there. So to turn it on, you go to settings and then security and privacy and then private space is near the bottom. So you confirm it's you and you pick a Google account and a new lock. If you want, then this private space is set up and basically you can always find it all the way at the bottom of your app drawer. Like that's where it lives. So obviously if you were to like give so on your phone to borrow for a while, you could put it in guest mode and it would just basically be a brand new phone for them set up. But yeah, private space is different. It's more of just a separate section under a separate lock underneath the phone that you're already logged into and signed up for. So it's basically a whole new little section of your phone hidden away behind a second lock for your top secret activities, apps, files, photos, whatever you want. And when you want to hide it away again, you just hit lock. You could put whatever you want in there. Totally up to you. Then number four. So I'm kind of combining a lot of these things. I've done this in videos in the past. It's just a whole bunch of the little things that sort of stack up to feel like a more refined experience. So number four is the little things. Like one of them is rich widget previews, which obviously is not a huge thing because how often are you actually adding new widgets to your home screen? Not very much. But when you do now the widgets that support this will actually show you content that will actually be on them before they get added and they're in live and real time and represent real things on your phone. This could have maybe been higher on my list. But at this point, it's so new that it's basically only like two of Google's apps. Like it's just a clocks and widgets around that. But it would be nice to see more Google apps and even more third party apps adopt this. Like I want to see in the example widget before I add it like my actual one of my actual notion boards instead of a made up one or one of my actual contacts instead of a random person. Another one is this new back animation when you move backwards through like settings or anything with multiple layers that you can back out of. I think it's a little bit smoother, a little nicer. Another one is Bluetooth audio sharing. You can have multiple headphones paired to the same Bluetooth audio source as long as they support Bluetooth LE, which most new headphones do. Another one is high quality mode when you use your Android phone as your webcam. Another one is Bluetooth auto on. So if you turn Bluetooth off on your phone, then the next day it automatically gets turned back on again so you don't have to remember to. And there's just a whole bunch more little things like that. It feels like every year Google pays attention to the little things about the way we use our phones and then can add stuff to help us there. But speaking of little things, I'm making number three by itself one of those little things, which is the new volume sliders. So right now when I hit volume, it looks the way it normally does. The auto live caption button is still there on the pixel, totally underrated feature, and then your mode switcher at the top. But then when you hit the three dots to expand, you get this whole almost full screen overlay showing where you're playing audio to and then all the sliders for volume of everything happening on your phone. And this is something that's been smaller and in various other forms and previous versions of Android. But I like this big one. It just makes it super clear what's going on and how loud each individual thing is going to be. So then now we're getting to the top. Number two is partial screen recordings. So I think normally when you do a screen recording on your phone, you just expect to see everything, right? You just start it. It's your home screen. It's every single app you switch between everything happening on your phone. That's that's a normal screen recording. But I've been playing with screen recordings here on the pixel with this dev preview and it's a lot smarter about only showing if you want individual single things happening on your phone. So when you go to initiate a screen recording, you can either do the entire screen, which is normal, or a single app. So check this out. If I do single app and then start recording, it gives me a picker to choose which app I want to record. I'll pick one of the ones I already have open, relay Reddit, just for this example. The countdown starts at the top and then it's recording this Reddit app. So I can scroll around, just use it as usual. But now watch. If I go home and then open another app like photos and then scroll around in here and then go back home, go back to the relay app, then scroll some more. That's the screen recording. Now check this out. When you go to watch the screen recording, it looks normal. But then the moment I go home and then go to photos, see that doesn't show up in the screen recording. It's still just recording the Reddit app, even though it's in the background now. And then you can see when I get back to it and start scrolling some more, it picks up where it left off. So it's only specifically showing what I want you to see. And this is super useful. I think this is my new default for screen recordings. You don't have to see, you know, a random text message I have coming in or me copying and pasting a security code from another app or anything like that. It's just me giving you a tutorial on like one exact thing that I want to show you. That's pretty cool. But the number one, this is one of those things that Android has been really good at and had the edge at for years, which is just better notifications and notification management. And so far with these two previews, it's even better in specifically a couple of ways. There is adaptive vibrations. There is notification cool down. There is custom vibrations. There's a whole bunch of stuff. So I'll walk through each. So adaptive vibration is fascinating. It kind of just seems like another one of those magic feeling Google things, but you go into vibration settings and just turn it on. There is no further settings. But it basically says it's using your phone's mic and other sensors to determine the sound levels around it. And potentially even what type of surface it's on to set the strength of vibration so you can always feel or hear it. So the idea is, if you phone is on like a desk somewhere or a hard surface, it doesn't have to rattle the thing at maximum strength to be heard. It can turn it down. But then if it's on a couch or something softer, it will pick that up and it will vibrate more loudly or more firmly so you can actually still hear it. Clever. And then there's another thing in dev preview one at least that was called notification cool down, which is literally just a setting to be able to help you manage when you get a ton of notifications from the same app over and over in a row. Because we've all been in that group chat that's going nuts or the Slack channel that won't shut up or a sauna or whatever, something that's just constantly pinning you over and over with the same app. And so notification cool down when you enable that will just sort of taper that off and keep you updated on when a bunch of new stuff comes in, but not just buzz you over and over. Now that was in dev preview one. And then this is dev preview two and it's not in this one. It's gone. I'm not sure why, but I hope they bring that back. I hope they keep it because that's pretty sick. And then there's an even more subtle one that's because it's basically hidden to users. This is something developers have seen which is individual vibration patterns per app because he's some of you aren't old enough to remember when smartphones had led notification lights on the multi color lights that would actually have a different color light up based on what app you were getting a notification from. So I could know without waking up my phone if I had a blinking blue light happening. Oh, that's a Twitter notification. I can ignore it. Or if it was a blinking green light, then it's a new Gmail notification and I can ignore it. But if it's a new blinking red light, then it's a new miss call. And I can ignore it. But then phones all got rid of these lights. So now we wake up our phones every time I want to check on something. And if you haven't always on display, that can be useful, but in a surface shown to developers, they have the ability now to customize their own vibration pattern specific to their app. So I think that's pretty sick. I'm kind of hoping, and this is totally just hoping, but I hope that they surface that to users as well. I hope just like I've been able to pick between a bunch of different weather icon apps for my one app that does weather. I hope they let me choose between a couple custom vibration sounds or vibration patterns for apps because I would love to customize and feel that I've gotten a Twitter notification and that I can still ignore it. Now for those wondering, since we check every year, when you go into settings, it doesn't actually say Android 15. It says vanilla ice cream for this dev preview too. And when you click into it, this is the animated easter egg, which looks nothing like vanilla ice cream, but for what it's worth, it's a little more space like. But now here's the thing. If you hold it down long enough, it speeds up all the way and then snaps and turns into this, this sort of random spacecraft in the middle of what seems like a nearly infinite canvas kind of reminds me of that asteroids game from back in the day, but you don't shoot anything. You just kind of fly around using this thrust vector and explore this gigantic space. The only thing that worries me is that in the corner, it says bodies, zero out of 10. So I think if people explore this thing long enough, they're going to find bodies, whatever that means. But yeah, like I said, a bunch of subtle things, some new notification stuff here and there, some new management usage of your phone type stuff. It's nuanced. It's subtle. I'm still excited for some of the bigger AI based features to drop because that's the stuff that we're expecting to make a big difference the way we use our phones. It's just not built into Android anymore. It's the AI stuff that your phone is capable of that's not in the OS. It's still good to see good on us features too. Let me know what your favorite one is or if you agree with my order of the top five in the comment section below. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,I Gave A Commencement Speech!,a7ItChBrY8E,2024-05-23T19:41:23Z,PT8M58S,1210461,82421,3836,"['MKBHD', 'commencement', 'commencement speech', '2024 commencement', 'Stevens', 'Stevens Tech', 'Stevens Institute of technology', 'Marques Brownlee', 'MKBHD commencement speech']"," Hey, what's up y'all, MKBHD here. A bit of a different type of video this time, so this year I was invited to give a commencement speech for the graduating class of 2024. For the school that I graduated from nine years ago, Stevens Institute of Technology, and so I said yes. And also, I've never given a commencement speech before, and so I'm not particularly well practiced at this type of stuff, but figured I'd give it a shot anyway. So I was told I was given seven minutes for this one, and actually you'll see, but I think I kind of nailed the seven minutes part. But the topic that I chose was basically pointing your energy towards something that you care about a lot, and that makes it easy to dive in and really make a difference in that thing. Obviously for me, it's these tech videos, but these are graduates of a tech school and a business school and all sorts of stuff, so they have a bright future ahead of them. And also, they were kind enough to give me an honorary doctorate degree while I was there. So the running joke is like auto-correct and all those auto-captions from years ago, it always say weird things instead of MKBHD, and one of them was MKBHD, and now that feels kind of like foreshadowing instead, kind of prophetic, impressive. Anyway, figured I'd share this in case it was inspirational to anyone who's young, who is graduating, who is also in the right demographic to enjoy it. So I'll let it take it from here. So I'm told I have seven minutes to really make impression on you guys. Most of the videos are heavily edited and way longer than seven minutes, so I'll try to keep it concise here so you can graduate. But first of all, I feel like I stand in front of you a little bit shocked at where we are because I feel like I was just there not that long ago, like a minute ago, I was sitting here graduating from Stevens, but then I checked and it was nine years ago, so 2015, it's like ancient history to you guys, so they say time flies. But when President for Verden invited me to come back here and give the commencement speech to you all, class of 2024, the school that I graduated from, I'm obviously honored and excited, and maybe a little bit nervous, there's a lot of people here, but I want to give you guys two things. I prepared two things for you. One is for now and one is for later. So I'll start with the thing for now, and I'm going to start with a quote actually, so it goes like this. As a large language model, I cannot help with your request to write a commencement speech. Just kidding. I'm kidding, kidding. I wrote this whole thing myself. I thought you guys would like that. But I'm actually going to start with a quote from an ultimate Frisbee teammate, so I know that's not the reason I'm here, but a lot of you guys may know, I played ultimate Frisbee when I went here to Stevens, I still play to this day. I remember really, really early in my ultimate Frisbee career, sort of the beginning of freshman year, there's a tri-out process and then the team was formed, and I remember we went to our first tournament, we were all in the huddle before our first game as a team, and the captain said, hey, guys, everybody take a beat, just take a deep breath, and just look around this huddle for a second. Like really appreciate this moment of becoming a team for the first time, because you're going to blink, and the whole season is going to be over way faster than you think. And he was totally right. Obviously, we played the game, there was lots of long points, and then lots of long weekends, of practices, and travel, and it's a grind, but we loved every second of it, and we all evolved a lot as teammates and as players, and it was great, but at the end of the season, we could all remember that first huddle. We remember that moment of just taking a beat. So while I have the chance, I want to encourage you all, sitting here with the gowns and the hats and everything, to just take a beat and look around at your fellow classmates, and your friends, people who you just spent a lot of time with, your family's here, this is your day to celebrate, and starting the next chapter of your life, but I also promise you that you're going to blink, and it's going to be 10 years later. So take a minute to enjoy where you are now. Now for later, I give you that for now, something for later. Here's the thing, I've always struggled with giving advice, I feel like, I don't know if President Fervard and knew that when he invited me to give a commencement speech, but I feel like I get asked to give advice a lot, and I don't really know what to say. Typically, it's like, here are some things that I learned, and I can pass them along to you, but I got to be honest, I feel like a lot of my success, you know, was the state of the world finding a niche, capitalizing on good luck, like there wasn't really any playbook or set of things that I strictly follow that I can pass along. It kind of felt just like it was something that I really dove into because it was exciting to me. So now I'm in this bizarre position of trying to give advice, but the more I've thought about it, the more I feel like the best advice that I can give you is to find something that gets you excited. That's really what it comes down to. So you're all sitting here today because you've made it to the end of a very challenging process, called college, starting the next chapter of your lives, and you're armed with a bunch of tools that you picked up along the way. You're basically at a launching pad. You just need somewhere to point that energy, somewhere to dial it up all the way to 100. And so I really feel like my best advice for you is this is the perfect time to take a minute and ask yourself those big questions like, who am I? What do I really want to do? What do I care about? How do I want to make an impact? How do I want to give back? What makes you feel excited? What makes you feel nervous? You've already been challenged, clearly, and you've made a lot of tough choices. You've had to learn new skills. I went to Stevens, I know you had to solve problems in innovative ways, you had to work alone, you had to work in groups, you had to make time for things that are really challenging. So you have all these tools, but purpose is also a tool. And to me, I feel like it's the most powerful one. I won't necessarily be a smooth ride, but I'm just finding what that is for you. Some of you are already sitting here like, I know what it is, I know what I want to do. Some of you, it might take trying something, it might be taking a risk. For some of you like me, it may be something that literally doesn't exist yet, which is very exciting. But whatever it is you decide to do, making a dent in the universe is much easier when you care deeply about that part of the universe. So for me, it was tech videos on the internet, for all of you, the sky's the limit, clearly. So I'll end with this. Graduation is an exciting time. It's also a great word, graduation. It's also a great album. But you actually, you graduate many times as a person, I think. You continue to level up and build and graduate over and over again yourself. I mean, obviously, wow. You obviously already had high school graduation. You're having, for many of you, this is your formal education graduation. But you might also have your first job graduation, or your second job graduation, or learning a new skill graduation, or overcoming a new fear graduation. Or maybe you talk to someone and you get inspired and absorb some information that unlocks a new part of your brain, that's another graduation right there. So, class of 2024, I wish you many more graduations. This certainly will not be the last one. Congrats on getting to this launching pad. And from one duck to another, congrats and good luck. Thank you."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,5 Weird iPad Pro (M4) Decisions,PHcDrXeyguM,2024-05-22T02:26:31Z,PT13M2S,3768446,121125,6010,"['iPad Pro', 'iPad Pro M4', 'iPad Pro review', 'MKBHD']"," Alright, so I've been using the new M4 iPad Pro for like two weeks now. Been doing a lot of the same stuff I did with my M1 iPad Pro from three years ago. Watching YouTube videos, browsing the internet, answering emails, listening to music, and spoiler alert, it's almost exactly the same experience. The M1 iPad Pro was already super overpowered and very smooth and snappy and had great battery life. And this one now, even more so of all the same stuff. Not a very helpful review, I know. But I've also been thinking about some of the really interesting decisions that Apple made with this iPad, specifically. Some stuff that wasn't like even really in the rumor mills, it kind of just came up, didn't even show up in the keynote, but is unusual and different. So these are five of the most interesting choices that Apple made with the iPad Pro. So first of all, the new iPad Pro is thinner. We all knew that. It was already an interesting decision because I kind of felt like we were done with that. A few iterations ago, like nobody was asking for thinner iPads, but maybe they saw all the gushing over Samsung's Galaxy Tab Ultra, guilty. That thing is also ridiculously impossibly thin. So iPad goes from 6.4 millimeters, which was slightly thicker than Samsung's flagship, to now 5.1 millimeters, which just barely beats Samsung's number. Now, you know, I'm not trying to start any beef that doesn't already exist. You know, I'm sure if you ask Apple, they'll just say, look, it's the thinnest Apple product ever, which is already nuts. It's crazy thin. But I think it really feels like Apple is just looking for something to make this different, to make it feel different from the last couple of generations of iPad. And now, there's rumors that they may also be doing this to next year's iPhone. It's just gone with thinness. Honestly, it is noticeably thinner and lighter to me, someone who's held the previous one quite a bit. Definitely less of a difference when you have a case on it, but this is also going to naturally mean there's less room inside the iPad. But weirdly, somehow, the 11 inch iPad Pro M4 has a larger battery than the last generation 11 inch iPad Pro. And this new bigger 13 inch has like a tiny bit slightly smaller battery, almost the same size battery as last year. And so what you end up with is a really good battery life again. Awesome standby time. Really good battery when you're actually using it. But what strikes me is Apple could have made if they made this the same thickness as last year. They could have made an iPad with an enormous battery life with the efficiency of the M4 chip. It could have had some insane long battery. Or they could make something strikingly thin and have the same rock solid battery life as always. But I would have loved to have seen option one. But anyway, there's also a few other things missing from this tablet as well. So they've wanted saying it during the keynote, but they got rid of the ultra wide camera. Not a huge deal at all, obviously. They kind of have a huge cut out for the LiDAR on the camera square. It still kind of looks like it's maybe a dual or triple camera setup, but no single camera, LiDAR and a flash. And I was also curious if Magnet Paper could reveal anything new about the insides of this iPad. This is before Jerry got everything like tour his apart. But I know instinctively if you make something thinner and smaller, then the speakers have to suffer, right? That would be smaller. And Magnet Paper, fun fact, is a great way not only to see the magnets inside of a device of which there are many here, but it also shows the iPad Pro has these new much more circular quad speaker drivers as opposed to the more rectangular looking ones from before. I've listened to them back to back this one versus the last generation. And this one is a little bit less basic. Still loud, still some of the best speakers in any tablet and very usable, but physics. So less room inside, a little bit less basic with these new speakers. Now packaging wise, not a lot has changed. I mean, an iPad box is still an iPad box, but two things. One, no stickers anymore. So sorry Apple fanboys, if you are hoping to keep collecting environmental things, no more plastic. They're trying not to ship so much stuff. But the thing is, okay, they are still shipping these two things with every iPad. If you get a space gray iPad, you get a black cable, so the USB-C cable, but you also still get a brick with every iPad. Fine, but it's this white 20 watt charging brick, which, okay, I know they stop shipping the brick with the iPhone and they could use the same logic and stop shipping a brick with the iPad, but they're still going to ship you a brick. And if you do with this $1,500, $2,500 iPad, could it at least be a good brick? Could you at least give us the fastest charging the iPad can support and maybe even match the color of the cable? Maybe. But anyway, maybe that's nitpicking. Hopefully not though. But let's talk about, let's talk about this computer thing. So the knock on the iPad Pro for years now has been that it's a ridiculously overpowered, amazing piece of hardware, but it's still an iPad. Like it still does basically the same set of things that an iPad Air does. There's a couple little things like pencil hover and little stuff. It's basically the same. So they're not going to let this turn into a full-fledged computer because Apple has max to protect. So it's kind of stuck as an overpowered iPad. And with this generation, well, yeah, it's still kind of true. Again, this is the first time Apple is unveiling the newest generation M4 chip. And it's only in this iPad Pro for now, but it's even more powerful at its peak. It benchmarks extremely well. It's a second generation 3nm process. It has a larger and more powerful neural engine as well. I mean, this chip is great. But as far as things that actually take advantage of that, the list is very, very short. And some of the stuff is even like coming later this year like the new final cut app is just around the corner. So if you just do regular iPad stuff, watching Netflix, web browsing, all the classics, like this is going to feel exactly the same, not just as the last M1 iPad Pro, but as an M1 iPad Air. You know, if you get this M4 version here, you can you can play those one of the like three games that support the new hardware accelerated ray tracing on this iPad. You can use the new stem splitter feature and the new logic pro 2 app for iPad that actually looks incredible if you use logic on the iPad. But the most interesting new thing to me about M4 is something that they didn't really talk about. They kind of glossed over it. They didn't really dive into it in the keynote and they don't show it on their website very clearly. But okay, in the past, when you're buying an iPad, all you really pay more for in a single iPad lineup is storage, right? That's just you start with, it'll be 128 gigs kind of a joke, but then you go up in price and you just pay for more storage and you can get different colors. And then a few years ago, very sneakily we started realizing, okay, you actually also get more RAM in the highest end models. So if you buy more storage, you'll also get more RAM. So eight gigs of RAM on the base ones and 16 gigs of RAM on the one and two terabyte iPad Pros. But now on this latest one, the stratification goes even further. Now it's also CPU course. So first of all, the base iPad Pro is 256 gigs now, thankfully. And you go from an eight core CPU to a nine core CPU with the M4, but that's just with the base two versions. The top two versions get another performance core. So those are 10 core CPUs instead of nine. And then there's also the nano-texture display option. And this is that matte finish one that I briefly got hands on time with at the event. I haven't gotten to see it since, but it does look pretty impressive even though I do have my durability concerns with it. But that anti-reflective finish is only available again on the top two options, the one and two terabyte iPad Pros, the expensive ones. So now if you're buying a more expensive iPad Pro, you're getting different amounts of RAM, different CPU, different storage options, and different display options. Very computer-like, if you ask me. Now the tandem OLED display to me is the most interesting thing about this new iPad Pro under the hood. But in practice, it's actually honestly just a bit of a brighter, more contrasty version of the same thing we've been looking at for years. A perfect example of the iPad's hardware outpacing the software is obviously a new OLED display. It would be great if you had like an all black background and maybe showed just a time, maybe fed an always on display. It could look super cool, but the iPad doesn't have an always on display. I don't want to bet money, but I wouldn't be shocked if the next version of iPadOS did support and always on display with just the pros because they have the OLEDs now. But it doesn't. We got a wait till WWDC and then maybe we'll see it there. But I mean aside from that, it still has less blooming for just like the perfect HDR content with pitch black blacks. I love to see that. If you're just watching regular SDR content though, or just doing any number of regular tasks, watching Netflix, browsing emails, or web stuff, I mean you won't notice much of a difference unless you're in direct-sun max brightness. That's a testament to how good iPad Pro displays have been for years in the past though. Now for your artists out there, they've also got this sweet new pencil. No, the back still does not act as an eraser as much as I wish they would do that, but the rest of this thing is better than ever. It supports Find My Now. It has a new squeeze sensor inside for selecting different tools, super intuitive. I started using it immediately. It also has a new haptic motor inside so you can feel this little click as you squeeze, which is a nice little confirmation. Kind of surprised I didn't add this earlier. And then it supports barrel rotation for a few tools that specifically change when you rotate the point. And look, it even has this fake shadow. So this is not a real shadow of the Apple pencil. This is a fake totally unnecessary computer-generated shadow that's shown on the iPad's display. And it actually matches the type of tool you're using in real time with rotation. That's just ridiculous. And instead of just calling it the updated Apple pencil, they're continuing to sell the old Apple pencil at the same price, and they're calling this one the new pencil pro. And look, I am not an artist. I am squarely outside of the target demographic for this thing. But what I do know is if this and its features are tempting to you, then you will need to buy a whole new iPad to take advantage of it. And that was on purpose. See, they moved the camera to the landscape side of the iPad now, which is great. That's where we wanted it to be the whole time. That's where the Face ID array is now. It's awesome. It's an ultra-wide camera for FaceTime and all that. But that's also where the pencil has always magnetized and charged. So they actually had to rearrange the components inside to be slightly different to work with both now in the same place. So it still snaps on the top like that. But did they have to do that? Couldn't they have put the pencil on the top of the iPad or maybe offset it so that the pencil is on one side and the camera is on the other side? But no, they've got it just in the middle where it always is. And I put some magnet paper up to the back so I can see that they did in fact change the magnet layout inside. Like I tried pairing the new Apple pencil pro to my old iPad pro and it kind of stuck on sort of but didn't pair do anything. All right, convenient. Look, I'm still personally not going to be buying one of these new M4 iPad pros because of what I do on the iPad pro and I already have a relatively new M1 iPad. So I don't need one. But if you don't have a relatively recent iPad, then yeah, this thing is great. It's better than ever. But I think we're all on the same page that we're waiting for WWDC later this year to see what's new with the latest version of iPad OS to see if there's anything actually interesting that this will be capable of that we don't already know about. Because other than that, it's kind of the same story as last few generations of the iPad pro. Speaking of things that are thin though, Dbrand iPad skins. Fun fact, you'd have to stack up 22 of Dbrand's iPad skins to make it the same thickness as the iPad itself. Trust me, I've tried it. It's exactly 22. Anyway, Dbrand has been making the best leather skins in the business for a while now, which is great because Apple actually isn't really making anything leather anymore. And this is good quality soft leather. Like it's not some sanded down and stamped fake texture. It's actually all natural full grain leather. It's plush and it'll actually develop a nice patina over time since you can literally own these iPads for years. So if you want to check out premium leather accessories for your iPad, check out channel sponsor Dbrand, link is in the description. Either way, that's been it. No need to thank. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,M4 iPad Pro Impressions: Well This is Awkward,-T0MGehwWvE,2024-05-08T02:06:33Z,PT12M51S,6079657,183542,12938,"['M4 iPad', 'M4 iPad Pro', 'iPad Pro', 'iPad Pro impressions', 'MKBHD', 'Pencil Pro', 'Apple pencil pro', 'Apple pencil', 'iPad Air']"," Okay, so Apple had a nice short little 30 minute event today announcing just a bunch of new iPad stuff. Now, this was the longest they've ever gone without updating anything iPad related, so they had some cooking to do. But the thing is, and I feel like we've been saying this for years, it kind of doesn't matter how powerful they make the iPad. It's still an iPad, right? It's still iPadOS, and we've seen gigantic improvements in the M-series chips and these iPads are like the most powerful chips ever on paper, but there's still iPads. So the last thing we need after all this time is just another spec-bumped iPad, right? Well, let me introduce you to the newest iPads. So first up, there's a new iPad Air, which follows the script of bringing a few things down from the previous iPad Pros, and of course, you know, making it available for this lower price. So it graduates from the M1 to the M2 chip inside. It starts up at 128 gigs of storage now, and it moves the webcam to the landscape bezel where it belongs. It gets faster Wi-Fi, and for the first time, there is a larger one now, so they're calling it the 11 inch and the 13 inch iPad Air. I had to clarify just because the last one was 10.9 inches, so are they just simplifying the name like is it actually bigger and turns out, yeah, there is just a little bit more screen here. Great, but other than that, it's pretty predictable. It's a spec-bump, like this is taken to the script here. I think I can hand you the newest iPad right now, and you couldn't really tell the new Air from the old Air just looking at it other than if you're holding the bigger one, or if you recognize the super exciting new colors. I mean, hopefully you can hear my sarcasm through the screen, but there's blue, purple, starlight, and space gray. So it's 5.99 for the small one, and 7.99 for the bigger one. But then we also got a more significant update to the iPad Pros. This is where they push the limits of the iPad. This is where they want to show their absolute best stuff, the best possible tablets. And man, if we just ignore the software for a second, these new iPads are ridiculous. So first of all, they start off by revealing that these new iPads, the 11 inch and the 13 inch, are the new thinnest Apple devices ever made. Ever. That's including phones, that's including like old iPods and everything. The 11 inch is 5.3 millimeters thin, and the 13 inch is 5.1 millimeters thin. So that's literally thinner than the iPad Nano ever was. It's nuts. It just looks ridiculous. It's crazy to hold. It's also lighter, as you might imagine. It just kind of feels like this impossible sheet of metal in your hand. I don't know if anyone ever looked at an iPad Pro and asked for it to be thinner, but that's what they went and did. What could possibly go wrong? In fact, this also now means that the iPad Air is heavier than the iPad Pro, just to make sure we keep a mess of an iPad lineup going. But the new Pro also gets a new chip and a new screen. So Apple took this event to introduce us to the next generation of Apple Silicon with the M4 chip, and this iPad is the only thing that it's in right now. It's just the iPad with M4. So that gives it, stop me if it sounds familiar, even more ridiculous amounts of power in such a tiny physical and thermal envelope, especially since we came from M2. So it's a more power efficient 3nm chip. The CPU core is net out to like 50% faster than M2. The GPU is up to four times faster, and they're saying that they can do the same performance output as M2 with half the power. So it's super efficient. There's an improved neural engine. There's better cooling. Now again, I don't know who was asking for a thinner iPad, but there's kind of no denying that it's at least just physically impressive to look at. And this is the type of thing. This is the form factor that is specifically enabled by the M4 chip. Apple is quoting basically the same battery life as the last iPad Pro. And I kind of have to assume that there's significantly less physical battery in the thing because it's so much thinner. So that just basically means Apple's going, hey, we think that that was enough battery life in the last gen. So we're just going to match that. And that means we can go way thinner with less battery because the new chip is more efficient. So then the new display. This is another thing that is actually kind of enabled also by the M4 chip. Sometimes it seems like they're just saying that, but this is also true. So these are OLED iPads now. Both sizes, it's the exact same set of features across both iPads, which kind of makes the $300 price difference between them a little bit tougher. But yeah, OLEDs on both the new iPad Pros. And OLED is awesome, right? We already knew this. We've had OLED phones forever, the pitch black blacks, the individually lit pixels, the super awesome vibrance like all of the OLED stuff is great. And we were excited to finally see it in a relatively gigantic display that is an iPad. But making a huge OLED that's also incredibly bright was a challenge that required just a little bit of extra engineering, little extra ingenuity. So they put together something that they're calling a tandem OLED display, which honestly, to me, I think this is maybe the most interesting part of the whole tablet event today. So you can basically think of it as two different OLED displays stacked on top of each other. And then the new display driver on M4 can address both layers simultaneously. So that's what's allowing them to get really high local brightness. And that's the spec now. That's a thousand nits of peak full screen brightness and 1600 nits of peak HDR brightness on an OLED on an iPad size screen. And in person, it looks, well, it looks like it really bright OLED. It looks super colorful, really bright, inky blacks, you know, in this hands-on area that I got to spend like 30 minutes in, it's not going to look its best and there's crazy lighting everywhere. But I will be getting my hands on it to review and I intend to dive in and find out if there are any downsides, but it looks pretty great here. And then also weirdly, they announced a nano texture matte version of the iPad Pro. So now there's a matte Pro Display XDR. I would be very careful about ordering this particular option based on what I've seen. Like I can see here that it is definitely better at dealing with reflections than a normal display. That's awesome. But just like the desktop version, that is at the expense of a little bit of sharpness and contrast. You know, the blacks don't look nearly as black to me even at zero degrees off axis. And I also have to wonder about durability because the Pro Display XDR is very picky. About which microfiber cloth you use and you can literally ruin it if you use the wrong one. And with this iPad, you know, I can feel the difference between the soft touch texture of the nano texture and the glossy bezels. And I just have a feeling that you're only going to be able to use or rely on the microfiber that comes in the box with this thing. And not only does it cost an extra $100 to get the nano texture, it's also only available on the one terabyte and two terabyte, high-estand models. So I think they know that like people shouldn't just walk in the store and just get it because it's on the base one. So yeah, just be careful with that one. But you know, it probably made the most headlines out of all the stuff announced today is the spec bumped Apple pencil. There's now a new Apple pencil pro. And it looks exactly the same as the previous Apple pencil, but with this new text on the back that says pencil pro on it now. Unfortunately, that's still not the eraser. But yeah, this new Apple pencil pro has a haptic motor inside, so it supports fine to my now. There's also a new squeeze sensor in the barrel for activating tools in different apps that will support it. And a new gyroscope actually makes it rotation sensitive. And I was trying this. It's surprisingly precise, like really, really good. So if you're an artist, not like me, maybe you're doing a barrel roll with certain drawing apps or calligraphy applications for the $129 that it costs to get one of these things. But another incredibly inconvenient note, this new pro pencil is only compatible with the newest recently announced iPad pro or iPad Air. Because when they moved that webcam to the long side, that's also where a lot of the magnets for lining up and charging a pencil where so I had to redesign the magnets up there. And that's now a different array, so it's only compatible with the newest iPads. Why didn't they just move it to the other side for charging? I don't know. Maybe that makes too much sense. And there's also a new magic keyboard as well, still ungodly expensive. But if you get the new one, it's also it's lighter than the previous gen, the trackpad is bigger, and there's a whole functioner at the top now, which actually that is super useful. And the pass through charging is even faster. Apparently it's 60 watts through the pins in the back. But all that being said at the end of the day, guess what? We just got another set of Spectrum to iPads. They are metal rectangles with incredible power and efficiency in our hands that are just still iPads. And I don't know how many more times I can say this, but like taking advantage of all of this power is nearly impossible. There are a tiny sliver of apps that actually make it feel like worth upgrading. There's almost nothing these iPads can do that my M1 iPad Pro can't do. And this isn't even to downplay the hard work, because the hard work is actually amazing. That's where the difference comes from. Like it's got this super bright high resolution OLED displays with pitch black blacks, this M4 chip with ridiculous power and efficiency, new CPU, new GPU, better neural engine. Like I've never wanted an iPad to be thinner, but that line about them wanting the iPad to feel like a magic sheet of glass really resonated with this model in particular. Even if you do feel like you could snap it in half the whole time. It's just the awkwardness of this one mainly comes from timing, because I think we all know, well, it's already been announced. WWDC, their worldwide developer conference, is right around the corner. And we all know and expect them to update all the software across all their stuff, a new iOS, a new iPad OS. So I guess iPad OS 18 and whatever Apple is going to decide to do with that is around the corner. So we've got these new iPads shipping next week, but all the new software that could be awesome. Well, that's this summer. And this feels like it could be one of the biggest updates yet to these iPads. You know, it's Apple showing their hand at how many more AI features they want to build in and how many more features people want to add that lets this be their primary computer, maybe more Siri improvements, all this stuff. So in this awkward meantime, here we have these really, really impressive specbumped iPad pros, the most powerful iPads of all time, the thinnest Apple devices literally ever made, but the list of things it can do is the same as my theory of M1. Just saying what a time to be alive. We can have announcements though. Ridge and I have finally launched our first product together. So it starts with the Ridge wallet, you know, the minimal high quality industrial wallet, the more modern way to carry cash and cards. Well, you might know I joined Ridge as the chief creative partner earlier this year, and we're finally releasing our first MKBHD gear together. So one of the first things we wanted to do is just make MKBHD versions of some of the existing stuff felt too obvious. So that's exactly what we're doing. So I love carbon fiber and matte black. I don't know if you knew that about me already, but those were my base inspirations for these two wallets. So the MKBHD carbon fiber 3K, this is just a bunch of lightweight ultra durable carbon fiber with the logo, and then the matte black everything wallet. This is just aluminum, but it's got this black oil filled engravement print, which is so sick. And then these wallets also come with a debossed MKBHD money clip, or you can do a cash strap, you can also attach these or detach them. You could also do an attachment for an air tag, so just to make sure you don't lose it. Or you can do a fine my card, which I've done as well, but yeah, I just carry this in my wallet all the time and I definitely won't lose it. And then of course, if you don't like my designs, that's fine. Ridge has like 50 plus other designs in their catalog. They've got NFL license team stuff. If you want to rock your team, the store is endless. And if you even think it could be time to upgrade, it's a great time to just try, because if you don't love it after 99 days, you can literally send it right back. No questions asked, pretty sick, and I'll let you in on a little secret. It's 30% off the new gear right now, but also any style if you order a wallet and a key holder at the same time. So just a two together boom, 30% off. And also 10% off, whatever you want at Ridge.com slash MKBHD. You're welcome. Yeah, I'm excited to be launching this stuff and also a bunch more coming up later this year. I won't say too much about it, but you can sign up at the same link if you want to get product updates. I'll just to only email you about that if you sign up. But yeah, let me know what you think of these new iPads in general. I mean, it's kind of an awkward waiting period until we get all the new iOS 18 stuff, but let me know what you think. New thin thinner than ever I pass. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys the next one. Peace."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,Google Pixel 8A Impressions: Just Get The 8!,B3szaVzQx0o,2024-05-07T16:18:33Z,PT7M23S,2434787,83368,4546,"['Pixel 8A', 'Pixel 8a', 'Pixel 8A impressions', 'MKBHD', 'Google Pixel 8A', 'Google Pixel']"," Alright so there is just one thing that's starting to feel a little bit weird with this new Pixel but I'll get to that by the end of this video. Let's just start with the obvious stuff what's actually new here. So I just got some hands on time with Google's new budget phone the Pixel AA and I can confirm they're mostly sticking to the script here. Keeping it simple, last year's phone was already really good, making a few key improvements where it counts and keeping the price the same. $500. $500 isn't cheap but it's also not a flagship. It's definitely in this nice little mid-range territory and I feel like that Pixel has been slowly catching up their hardware to the rest of the competition in this price point. So at first glance it is, well pretty unmistakably a Pixel with the camera bar up top but there's a little change. There's a little bit more rounded edges. I really hope I'm not the only one getting round SpongeBob vibes from these corners but that's definitely what I see. But that's the main design change back here and then also around the back it's still got wireless charging. It still has the same main camera sensor as the 7a with an ultra wide next to it but now there's new colors and this new matte texture. So there's a black and a white that are called Obsidian and porcelain which look pretty tame. But then there's also a new green and blue called Aloe and Bay and they are definitely more vibrant. The rails and the camera bar are all aluminum still, it's still IP67 rated and then there's a slightly larger battery. But I mean we're talking very slight here. I think it goes from 4,385 milliamp hours to just over 4,400 but it still has wireless charging too. Then on the inside it's been bumped up to the new Tensor G3 chip from last year's flagships. So we know it's decently capable if a little inefficient but then it'll also start at 128GB of storage but for the first time they're also going to offer a 256GB version of the A phone as well. And then around the front and improved display. So it's the same size, still 6.1 inches, still has the middle hole punch cutout for the selfie camera, still has an optical fingerprint reader but it's now an actua display. So the peak brightness is 40% higher than before and I think it's noticeable. This is one of those things that makes a big difference to everyday life and usability just being able to see it outdoors and it's now a PO lid that gets up to 120Hz instead of the 90Hz like last year. Now before you even type it, I know a lot of people are going to argue immediately this is not something that makes much of a difference to most pixel buyers and you're right. In fact many of them will not notice this improvement just because smooth display is actually off again by default so it's a 60Hz phone out the box and then you have to know to go into the settings and turn it on and knowing it'll impact battery life. And then even once you do it's not like locked at 120Hz, it's dynamic up to 120Hz. So I played around with this phone for a little bit, it did feel very smooth to me, it feels nice at 120Hz so I'm personally happy about that change but I won't dwell on about it for too much longer. So from there you already know what a pixel is, right? This is the mid-range slash budget version of the phone with great software. Like this is the one with the really smart AI features like call assist and pixel VPN and magic eraser audio and all kinds of other classic Google features. It's the one with easily the best speech to text, transcription speed and accuracy I've ever used on a phone, it's reliable enough to just write whatever you want, emails, texts, notes, whole paragraphs as fast as you want. It's also the one that's promised seven years of updates, OS updates, security updates, feature drop updates and it's the one with really good cameras. Mostly basically unchanged from last year but all the Pixel 7a did was literally get the highest elo rating on our recent blind smartphone camera test with millions of votes up against other top tier flagship phones. So I'd say that's a pretty good baseline. So it seems like a pretty safe bet, pretty easy bet if you were a Google or Pixel fan. But I'll just say here are my worries with this Pixel. So first of all, this is the first A-Series device that they're going to enable Gemini Nano on and Nano is the one that can go locally on the device entirely which is great. They're probably going to make a big deal about it at the event and talk about it more at Google I.O. and all this stuff. But there's also now like this weird inconsistency with different assistants on the Pixel phone. It's not even just this phone but now you've got the Gemini app like shown off prominently on the home screen on these Pixel 8a's which is the latest available and most capable voice and multimodal AI search that they have. But then the Google search page right next to the home screen, if you tap the mic there that's going to a totally separate but also very capable Google voice search with Google Assistant. Google is literally now developing two different assistants side by side with overlapping but not fully congruent capabilities. It's just a little weird, a little inconsistent and we saw it coming and we knew this would happen but I think they'll eventually have to consolidate them all into one. I think Gemini will do everything at some point. But then hey, I guess the other thing you keep in mind is the price. So again, this phone is going to launch for $500 US. Mid-range phone, mid-range price, everything seems reasonable here. But let me remind you, you can still buy. Last year's phone of the year, brand new Pixel 8 for $550. So this 8a right now is not that much cheaper than the 8. And if you do go with the 8 while it is a couple months old now, sure, you're also getting a phone with thinner bezels and a brighter higher quality display, arguably even better cameras with bigger sensors, a bigger battery, faster charging, IP68 and it's the same 10th-ser-g3. Like, is that not a way better feeling deal? I mean, if you can find one, use that's even better. Pixel 8 was just such a good phone for that price that it makes phones both more and less expensive. Feel like worse buys. Like I talked about how Pixel 8 Pro feels like such a hard sell because it's $250 more. But now it also kind of makes the Pixel 8a look a little too high priced. So either way, I'm sure Pixel 9 and 9 Pro when they come out will shake things up. But as of right now, Pixel 8a is just, it's a solid mid-ranger, solid. It's got all this stuff you kind of already know you're getting from a Pixel. And if you also plan on picking one of these up, then Channel Sponsored Dbrand also has you covered with their Hydro Dip skins. Now I've been using Dbrand skins literally since 2013. So that's over a decade now. And the biggest thing for me is they basically add no thickness obviously to the device like a case would, but they can still totally change the look and feel. Now beyond just the Pixel skin and case, Dbrand also supports with the Hydro Dip skin almost 200 devices. So there's phones but also laptops, tablets, consoles, you name it. And there's four colorways of this one. So gold rush, solar flare, toxic waste and cotton candy. I'm thinking gold rush is the best looking one out of the bunch like I'm into the black white and gold combo super clean. But honestly, they all look pretty unique. So if you have a favorite, I'll leave a link down below so you can grab one for yourself. But yeah, that's basically it. Let me know what you think of Pixel 8a versus Pixel 8 in this weird six month release stage thing Google is doing. I'll check the comments. Either way, thanks for watching. Catch you guys the next one. Peace."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,Rabbit R1: Barely Reviewable,ddTV12hErTc,2024-04-30T00:21:20Z,PT19M53S,7771745,232750,21869,"['Rabbit R1', 'Rabbit vs', 'Rabbit R1 vs', 'Human AI pin', 'Humane pin', 'MKBHD', 'Rabbit R1 review', 'AI in a box']"," So this is the Rabbit R1 and it's another AI in a box and it's a sign of the times. So this thing here it has a lot in common with the humane AI pin for better or for worse, but it's also supposed to have two specific things that are supposed to set it apart from that. It's supposed to, anyway, and we have to talk about it. So stop me if this sounds familiar at any point, but check this out. This is a virtual assistant in a box, but it's a different box. This one is not wearable. It's a thing you have to carry around with you in your pocket like a smartphone. I'd say it's about the size of a stack of post-its maybe, but it's this lightweight plastic cube designed by Teenage Engineering. And boy do people love some Teenage Engineering right now. And it's super, I mean you can tell exactly what it is for a mile away. This thing is very recognizable. The thing has one button on the right side. That's the one you press and hold to ask it questions. And then instead of a projector, it actually does have a built-in screen here. And instead of built-in cellular, it has a SIM card tray right alongside that USB type C port for charging. I'd say it does seem to send basically every single request to the cloud, but I will say it does feel significantly quicker to answer questions than the humane AI pin. Now that is a very, very low bar to clear, but it is consistent. It's consistently quicker. How far away is the moon? The average distance between Earth and the moon is approximately 384,400 kilometers. You can connect headphones via Bluetooth or turn the built-in speaker all the way up like I have, but it also shows you the text of your answer on the screen right underneath this bouncing rabbit and the time in the battery. Matter of fact, it basically always shows this bouncing rabbit all the time. That's how you know it's awake. You hit that button once to put it to sleep or it would do that automatically after a few seconds. Then hit the button again to wake it up, boom, just the rabbit waiting for you there. And then to get to settings, there's no button to press for that. There's no gesture on the screen or anything. You just shake it like an edge of sketch. As long as you do that, then from there you can scroll up and down with this scroll wheel and select with the button. That's how you get around the UI. The other two things it has are the scroll wheel and a swivel in camera. So the scroll wheel for navigating around the UI instead of the screen is, I'll get to why it's odd in a second. But then of course, the AI assistant is multimodal and so you can use vision to answer questions about what it sees. So you've seen this before. With this one, you double tap to swivel it open and then press and hold to ask, I don't know what type of plant is this. Looking a look now, the plant in the image appears to be a monstera delitiosa, also known as a Swiss cheese plant. This is a type of tropical, climbing evergreen plant native to southern Mexico and parts of Central America. The large glossy green leaves with distinctive. As a reviewer testing this thing, I just feel like that DJ Khaled clip after a while where I'm just pointing at stuff like, okay, what is this? And what is this? And what is this? Those are pickled for nanopubberies. And what is this? I perhaps wouldn't say that. But I've also just pointed it at my computer screen with a really long email on it and asked it for a summary and it just reads it instantly and gives me a summary of it. It's something with articles too. I think that's pretty cool. But yeah, it's just an AI and a box. It's best at just answering questions. So yeah, this thing is also bad at a lot of stuff and this list is going to sound pretty familiar. But the battery life is just as bad as the humane pin. It has a thousand million power battery inside and it's brutally bad. Like it's already bad enough when you're carrying around a whole other device alongside your smartphone. But when this one can sit in front of you doing nothing and the battery just visibly is draining and dies in like four hours, then you have to charge it multiple times per day and it's still dead when you wake up in the morning. Like it's just exhausting. So it took 45 minutes to charge this tiny battery from zero to 100. And it's also just straight up missing a ton of what I would consider just basic features. Like the can't set alarms, can't set timers. It can't record videos, can't record photos, can't send emails. There's no calendar built in. There's just a lot of things that I would want an assistant to do, not here. And of course, being an AI assistant, it also does still hallucinate and confidently answer questions wrong. Like my baseline of asking a question that I know the answer to and then getting the wrong answer happens all the time, which is one of the downfalls of this category. So this device was designed by teenage engineering and they're really leaning into that. Like that's why I mean, it's this bright orange. It is really quirky, friendly looking device, I would say intentionally. But yeah, they really love their analog controls. This scroll wheel here doesn't surprise me. But it's actually really frustrating to use. First of all, it protrudes out the back a little bit as you can see, which looks kind of cool. But that means if it was really sensitive, that it would actually scroll if you just put it down on a table or something. So they've dialed down the sensitivity of the scroll wheel. So it's actually super slow. Like there's a surprising amount of scroll motion required to go down one line in the settings. And then there's no haptic feedback here as you're scrolling to help you feel it out. So fine, okay, you can get used to that. You use the button to select. But then you've also noticed there's no back button anywhere on this device. So to go back up a level, you have to scroll all the way back up to the top every single time that also gets annoying. And then to change brightness or volume, you actually need to hand. So you just go into brightness to select and you hold the button with one hand and then scroll the scroll wheel with the other hand to adjust brightness, which yeah, you just you can't do with one hand. It works so you can learn it and you can say, you know, it's this quirky UI. It's got going on. But I feel like a lot of these problems would be solved if this was a touchscreen. So what if I told you this is a touchscreen and they just don't really let you use it for almost anything? Like moving through these menus would be easier if I could just tap what I wanted to, right? Going back after a long scroll would be easier if I could just flip scroll back to the top of a list and hit back. But you can't. The only thing you can use the touchscreen for is basically typing on the keyboard in terminal mode. So with terminal enabled, you can turn it sideways, a keyboard pops up and you can type your questions and get text answers, which is great. And you can move between letters with the scroll wheel. It's kind of a neat feature, I guess, but why can't we use the touchscreen for anything else? And then I'm trying not to look too much like a smartphone. Maybe. Probably. So, okay. What's the point? Why does this thing exist? If it's so similar to the other one, that was also so bad. What are we doing here? And really there's two things that I think they're hoping will be the things that set it apart from the other one that should, in the words of their co-founder, Jesse. But I don't think I'm KVHD. We'll say this is the worst device here ever reviewed so far. Which low bar, but okay. Those two things are the price tag and the large action model. So the humane pin was so easy for everyone to dunk on because it was, it cost as much as a phone. It was $700 with a $24 a month subscription to not turn into a brick. It's just insane. So this one right here costs $200 and no subscription. So, okay, that hits a little different. But also, you can tell it's $200. First of all, you will need a separate SIM card to get it to work on cellular. So while there is no subscription fee for rabbit to keep the device working, that is still a fee you're going to pay every month to get data outside of Wi-Fi. But then, okay, the unboxing experience is extremely minimal. It comes in a single cardboard box with a cassette tape-looking plastic container that doubles as a stand. But there is literally nothing else, no charging brick, no USB-C cable, no stickers, no paper instruction manual, nothing at all. And then the R1 itself is made of plastic. Not to say that it's not built well. You know, there's no flexing or creaking or anything like that. But it's definitely plastic. The camera, very basic, the speaker, very cheap. You know, it's a low-end media tech chip inside. The same one that's in the Moto G8 power light, which is like $150 phone. Really any battery, as we learned, and no fancy fast charging or wireless charging. And it comes in one color, really bright orange, like this ridiculously saturated bright orange. I'm not even joking. The color you're seeing in this YouTube video on your screen, it's going to be the best I can do with my own color correction. But it's legitimately hard to photograph. Like, the phone camera doesn't really turn saturation up high enough to really represent and accurately in real life. It's the brightest orange thing you've ever seen in your life. I guarantee it. Now, if you want something a little more low-key than the neon orange, Channel Sponsored D-Brand actually does have you covered here. I've got this black camo looking one here. And now the orange bits that show through are kind of like more accent pieces, which is pretty dope. But fun fact, D-Brand also collaborated with Rabbit ahead of the release to make sure screen protectors for this thing were also available all-munched-day. So that includes mine. If you want to check it out, screen protectors or skins for the R1, you can hit up the link below. Speaking of the screen, this is a 2.9-inch diagonal TFT screen with no auto brightness. So yeah, I think you get the idea. So you know how the humane AI pin had no apps? Well, this thing also has no apps. But the other thing that they're hoping will separate it from the other stuff is what they're calling a large action model. So you know, large language models are just the words, the language that we use. So it's an AI that can take our natural language and process it and turn it into words in return. And that's how we interact with it. So a large action model is supposed to take our words and then process it and turn it into actions as the theory. So it's basically going to be able to use apps for you like a human would based on what you tell it to do. Now, importantly, this isn't the same as an API where, you know, a company might work with the others to have some sort of a plug into their services that they work together. Because an API can be a little too restrictive or not give all the features or just not quite, I mean, there's lots of good reasons why they don't want to rely on an API. So what this is supposed to be doing is just going in and using the app just like a human essentially with like a mouse and a keyboard. Think of it as like a virtual agent. Honestly, I think it's a really cool idea. I think it's a really, really cool idea. You know, large language models have been trained with all their data to talk back to us just like humans would and some are very convincing. So a large action model in theory should be able to use these apps and services just like a human would from Spotify to Twitter to your banking app to whatever else. It's already good enough at recognizing major UI elements like a play button or a buy button and things like that. So with enough training data, it could get really good with enough training data. It could get really good. But the thing is they don't have a ton of training data yet. So as of right now, they have made four apps available. Four they have this online portal called the rabbit hole where you can log into and enable all of them. Spotify, Uber, DoorDash and mid journey. So the rabbit can talk to these four apps and has a UI on the screen for doing so in the exact way that we're theorizing. So it'll play Spotify songs like I can ask it for a song and it'll try to play the right one and it'll show you any info you need on the touchscreen to confirm or refine the actions you're taking. But even now, they kind of work like I've already had issues with it playing the wrong song. I've also seen other people already have issues with the DoorDash app getting things wrong, which is even more frustrating. I can't imagine how frustrating the Uber app messing up would be. It definitely seems like it needs more training data and that's just for these four starting apps. Now, rabbit says they have 800 different apps trained already, but they just haven't built a UI for it yet. So it's not available on the rabbit yet. And so that's still in the works. Now they've also theoretically started working on something called a generative UI where essentially it can recognize what type of app it is and then build a UI for it. So rabbit doesn't have to, but that's also still theoretical and also on the roadmap and still on the works. And then if there's another app or service that you want your rabbit to be able to do, like something for work or something super niche that you've invented, they've talked about something called Teach Mode, which is basically having the rabbit watch you do what you want it to do on your mouse and keyboard. And then it learns from what you did and can then repeat your actions later, which is sick. Unfortunately, you can probably already see where this is going. Teach Mode is also not available as of right now. This is something you're still working on vetting and finishing. And so that's just later this year also in the works. So as of right now, this device has none of that stuff, just the four kind of half-working apps that we went over at the beginning. What are we doing here? Okay, I'm going to try not to turn this into a rant, but I just, I feel like we need to acknowledge at least that a lot of these tech companies are developing tech kind of backwards. Like they're delivering such unfinished products that it actually makes them nearly impossible to review. Like it feels like it used to just be make the thing and then put it on sale. Now it's like put it on sale and then deliver the half-baked thing and then iterate and make it better and hopefully with enough updates then it's ready and it's what we promised way back when we first started selling it. And then this whole period in the middle is a mess. And it's across all kinds of product categories too. We've seen this with gaming, like huge studios are delivering half-baked games saying, oh, it's an alpha version, like there will be updates. But meanwhile, it's a full price triple-A game that's just got an unacceptable number of bugs and issues. It's also happening with cars and vehicles getting announced and then delivering with like a half-finished state where you just don't get a lot of the features that you paid for and they're eventually coming soon with a software update. You know, smartphones obviously we've been seeing this for years, but it does seem like now more than ever. There's at least one feature, one major feature of every smartphone launch that gets announced, but that's not coming until later in the year. And now these AI-based products are at like the apex of this horrible trend where the thing that you get at the beginning is like borderline non-functional compared to all the promises and all the features and all the things that it's supposed to maybe someday be. But you still pay full price at the beginning, which is what makes it so crazy. And that sucks not only obviously for the people buying it at full price at the beginning, but also for reviewing these things in general. Like how do you assess a product where the version of what's promised in like three years, what it could be is amazing, but the version that's being delivered now is dog water. Like how do you connect those dots? Do you even connect those dots? Are you supposed to give them benefit of the doubt? I don't know. What are we even doing here? On one hand, it is good that tech products, these things can get better over time and improve, and the thing you buy can be better tomorrow. That's all great. That didn't used to be true, and that's beautiful and everything. But on the other hand, it's just the other side of that coin is some very unfinished products being delivered, and I just feel like it's going to get worse before it gets better. So let me just say, I am personally very excited by the idea of a super personalized AI assistant that can do everything that a human assistant could. That's my dream. I want that to happen, and I'm interested that these different companies are approaching it from different angles, and hopefully we'll get there eventually. But this is also so clearly going to take a lot of time and effort and technical development, and also a lot of data. Like I've said this already in the human review, I'm pretty sure, which is a good assistant needs to know everything about you, whether it's human or virtual, like it needs to know your preferences and your location, and what you're doing and what you like to do, and every single little thing, it's so much data. So as for the rabbit, I think that's why they focused on getting the price so low. Like this stuff is all a tough sell because you're taking a gamble on what the product could be someday, but for the pin, you have to drop $700 and $24 every month on the chance that it might someday get there. Like that's a lot of money. But for this cute little thing, $200 feels like a much easier investment to make, a much easier pill to swallow to just take a gamble on it, and on the off chance it turns out to be off some in a couple of years, it'll feel like it's worth it. So on the chance that some of those 800 apps are super useful, or even though you already have a smartphone, maybe the teach mode lets it do something with a single button press that you could never dream of before, then it could be totally worth it. The whole situation reminds me kind of of if you look back at the beginning of when Tesla started shipping cars with all the autopilot stuff, they were selling cars and they got popular for other reasons. It was a good electric car with good range and good charging network. And then people started sort of beta testing this autopilot stuff and Tesla starts collecting millions of miles and hours of data from how it works in the real world. And so all of that data helped their systems learn and get the head start that they need on trying to make the best autopilot software. So the rabbit, I'm sure, would like to use their price advantage and get as many of them out into the real world as possible into people's hands so they can start beta testing and having it trained and getting good at a variety of tasks. But the rabbit's problem is it doesn't have like the other reason why people would get it anyway today. So it's like a kind of a chicken and egg problem. So if you want my advice, you've heard it before. Buy the product based on what it is today and not what it's promised to be in the future. And with this category, that's like the hardest thing to do. The hardest thing to keep in mind because the promise is so big, but that's still my advice. And I guess we still also have yet to see what big companies like Google and Apple are going to try to do in this space probably this year. So with all of that, we'll see. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,I Tried a Disney Secret Project!,1KEtxTQUzxY,2024-04-26T14:26:53Z,PT11M33S,6961013,277871,7467,"['disney holotile', 'holotile', 'disney', 'MKBHD', 'disney VR floor', 'moving floor', 'dope tech', 'disney imagineering', 'imagineering', 'disney labs', 'labs']"," Okay, I got to see something really, really cool. I got to visit some of the secret labs inside of the Walt Disney Company called the Disney Imaginering Labs. So you know, it seems that people talk about them a little bit before, but obviously Disney has all these attractions and theme parks and rides and somebody has to design and engineer all that stuff. And there is a surprising amount of tech that goes into it. And some of it is still experimental and unreleased, where no one outside of Disney, well, except for me now, has got to use them. This thing is so cool. So Disney Imaginering has a bunch of these buildings scattered around this California neighborhood that I got to visit where they make realistic animatronic robots as part of their attractions. They literally greeted me at the door with these little droids, the same ones that are roaming around the theme parks. And these things have a striking amount of similarities to the Boston Dynamics Spot Robot that I got to play with you a few years ago. You know, that spot robot was able to navigate any terrain with an adaptive gate and it followed instructions from a custom but surprisingly easy to learn controller so that it could navigate around and do jobs that humans want and is also super fun to play with. These little droids for the theme parks are a lot of the same stuff. They are able to adapt to any terrain. They walk around. They follow instructions from a customized steam deck as the controller, which took me like 60 seconds to learn and they can navigate around relentlessly all day interacting with guests at a theme park and being fun to play with. It was super fun. And it's also seriously crazy how much tech is even inside one of these things. It's literally it's blending all these animations together from the walking to the standing and looking around. It's pretty cool, but that's not even what I was there to try. I was there specifically to be the first person outside of Disney to walk on the hollow tile. So you might have seen some videos about this, the hollow tile. It's this insane one of one 360 degree treadmill like a moving floor basically. It's still in an experimental phase and this is the only one that exists but it's already got these gears turning in my head about future potential applications, particularly in VR and actually one specific thing that I have reservations about but I'll get to that in a minute. I don't know that anyone's actually fully explained exactly how this thing works yet, but you can see that they're basically walking across a huge number of these tiny one inch discs that are spinning on top of their bases like a bunch of tiny treadmills and then turning to match the direction that you're walking. So obviously a normal treadmill is one direction, right? Just one flat plane moving forward and spinning around so you always know exactly where you're going. So if you want to build a treadmill, that's responsive and can go in any direction. Well a flat treadmill, it would be really hard, right? It would have to spin around quickly to match whatever direction you're walking, which is just kind of insane. So instead built into the floor is a bunch of articulating cones with discs on top of them with motors inside to spin those discs. And then the key here is the discs are tilted. So only the edge of the disc in the air is the part that's actually touching what's on the floor. So it's less of a flat treadmill and more of a bunch of small blades that are rotating under your feet. So when you walk forward, they spin clockwise to move your foot back to the middle once it's landed. And actually when you walk backwards, they spin counterclockwise to move your foot back to the middle. So no matter where you go, whatever direction you walk, no matter how long or how fast your stride is, it'll always pull you right back to the middle. So I've seen these videos that Disney's put out of this guy walking on it, but we've got to work our way up to that. I've never walked on it before and it's capable of some other things. So let's let's graduate. Let's get there. So there are three ways to control this thing. There is walking on it obviously, but there's also using a controller, like a PlayStation 5 controller. And there's also just straight up using the force and just pointing at it with your hands. Let's start there. First we put this Apple box on the hollow tile. And there's a screen up here that shows in real time all of the inputs and what the sensors are seeing both on the floor and around the floor. And they've actually mapped anything that crosses a certain line in front of me to move whatever object is on the floor. So when I move my hand in front of that line, the program moves the floor around to match the movement of the object with the movement of my hand. And this is pretty sick. I assume everyone watching this has seen Star Wars and realizes how dope it would be to have something like this in some sort of Star Wars experience in a theme park. So this is already super cool. But then the first time I actually get to get on the hollow tile myself is in a chair and with a PlayStation controller. So I am going to be in a chair where the chair is on a piece of wood so it's just flat bottom and then they just hand me the PlayStation controller. And well, see for yourself. So the left joystick is mapped to control position and the right joystick is mapped to control position and the right joystick controls rotation. So you can spin around and move around freely and actually get pretty quickly used to this thing. And if you're wondering, yes, I can steer myself completely off of the floor. It would let me. I was just kind of trying to be careful to not fling myself off the edge. But it moves so fast. So now after all that, now that I've experienced how it moves, now they're going to let me walk on the hollow tile. All right, so I'm going to start with training mode, which is a fraction of the normal speed, but we'll still get me used to how this works. So I'm ready. Great to one enable. Training mode is on. So now slowly start to walk. I can feel them kind of wiggling a little bit, but not really moving too quickly yet. So this is normal. Oh, OK, now they're starting to move. And my feet are starting to move with the tiles. There we go. So as I slowly walk a little bit faster, a little bit more quickly, a little longer strides, I'm getting more use to the feeling of the tiles. So they designed this to be about a two minute process. Because these tiny tiles slowly speed up their responsiveness to my movements. And it was slowly turned up more and more, basically until it was at 100% real time. It's moving pretty close to full speed now. Feels like. And there's obviously a learning curve, but I feel like I'm good enough at it that I can kind of walk around and not think too hard. It's good. And then there's all the data behind me in real time showing my feet, my legs. So walking on this, I noticed a couple things. First of all, as you've heard through this video, it's pretty loud. Like, this is going to be something they definitely are going to want to work on, especially if it's something that will be a part of a theme park someday, or maybe even in someone's home. But also, I find it fascinating. You're never actually quite walking in a perfectly straight line. Like, it can feel pretty close if your foot happens to line up along a row of discs that are all aligned in a way from the center. But other times, you're just kind of gliding over the top of a bunch of these ridges. And you're not moving in a perfectly straight line. I imagine a future version of this looks like a whole bunch of much smaller and more numerous discs that are just as powerful as they are, which is clearly an engineering challenge, or an engineering challenge. So yeah, this takes some getting used to. I know that because I got to hang out with the inventor of the holotile, Lanny Smooth. He's been at Disney for more than 20 years. He's got more than 70 patents, including the way the BB-8 rolls around the park, the real-life lightsabers, just to name a few. He's kind of a legend. And yeah, this guy's incredible on it. He was showing me that you can have two people on it at once. They were playing a multiplayer racing game, like controlling a BB-8 around a course by jogging around. And it seemed to work pretty well, aside from being pretty small. Obviously, this would work better if they had more of these floor tiles. But then what I found the most crazy is using this floor with a VR headset on. So this is what you would expect it to be for for VR, right? And there's been some other 360 degree treadmill type of videos I've seen, other types of inventions used for VR. And they work. But the one thing that's hard about these, and it's hard to explain through video, but the difference between what your eyes see and what your body and brain feel, that disagreement. So it meaning, like, this has always been true. If you look down at your phone a lot in a moving car, right? Your eyes are seeing something still. They see your body sitting still, but then your brain and your inner ear feels you moving around moving forward. And so the disagreement between what your eyes see and what your brain feel, that's what can give you motion sickness. That's what feels bad. And so if you think about it, it's the same thing with this moving treadmill in VR. You put the headset on and you start walking. And your eyes see that you are walking down a moving hallway. You're moving forward, but your brain, because you're walking in place, doesn't feel that it's supposed to be moving forward. So again, there's a disagreement there. So with the hollow tile, I got to try putting on an Apple Vision Pro and actually walking around a 3D constructed environment. You can't see it, but I'm in like a hollow deck and star trek or something. And then I've got a harness on because it turns out this is really hard. My eyes see the movement and my legs are trying to walk forward and my feet are sliding around but my brain thinks I'm not supposed to be moving forward. So it's confusing. It's hard to just trust it and walk. Plus there's the extra layer of sometimes it moves you backwards a little bit to the center. So I was taking all these baby steps. Meanwhile, the watchlanny do it. And he's just incredible at it. Like he had the headset on, he was walking around confidently through space, exploring a virtual world. Pretty sure it's like a virtual Disney theme park type of thing. But that's the type of thing that feels the most like the future. Just freeform, exploring some huge space, walking around in a comfort of your own home maybe. And that would be amazing. And if this thing can continue to be developed, maybe, just maybe, you can get us closer to that reality someday. Either way. That is definitely dope tech. I'm glad I got to see the first version of this and I'm very curious and excited to see future versions. Disney, please invite me back. I want to see what the future of this actually looks like. Okay, that's it. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,"$20K vs $2,000,000 Hybrid Car!",HLi2xYxZX10,2024-04-22T16:55:14Z,PT14M45S,2957359,90202,3753,"['hybrids', 'hybrid cars', 'mclaren speedtail', 'MKBHD', 'Auto Focus', 'hybrid vs electric', 'electric cars', 'electric car vs']"," So in a world of electric cars, in this video, we're going to be taking a look at a $20,000 hybrid, $120,000 hybrid, and a $2 million hybrid car. So this video is part and explainer, part a chance to drive some really sick cars, shout out to Triple F collection. We'll get there. Anyway, unless you guys have been living under a rock, you've seen that electric cars have been having a bit of a renaissance lately, surging in popularity, till the number one best sold new car on earth is electric. But they are still very much a new technology. Like they're obviously awesome with instant torque and no emissions and fast acceleration, but they have these huge heavy batteries, and they take forever to recharge, and there's not enough infrastructure for everyone to own them. So there's this window now where it makes a lot of sense that maybe for most people a hybrid is actually the best option. Interesting. So I don't think anyone's buying the Corolla for speed or power. I mean, if I'm being honest, it's actually still pretty zippy. So this car starts at $24,000, and it's a hybrid purely, purely for efficiency. So the basics of this hybrid system, and many others in the same class, is that the wheels can be driven by the gas engine or the electric motor, or both. So this Corolla hybrid has a 1.8-liter engine and one electric motor at the front axle that deliver a combined 138 horsepower, and it's powering the electric motor with a pretty small 1.6 kilowatt hour battery. So at low speeds, you've probably been in a car like this. The car goes totally electric. The gas engine turns off, but once you go over a certain speed or use a certain amount of power, then it's going to fire up the gas engine again, and it couples it with the electric motor. Then anytime you're breaking or coasting, that's when it charges the battery back up. It's as you're slowing down, it captures some of that energy. So it never actually needs to be plugged in to charge up that small battery, and this system is good for literally 50 miles per gallon. When you drive this car, you literally have a game score and eco score as you drive. If you can slow down and roll onto your accelerations better and roll to a stop more easily, you can gamify efficiency in this car to get your maximum miles per gallon. So it actually divides it up. I have my eco zone, so I'm driving, and if I get my little bar in the eco zone, I'm doing a good job. And then I have starts, cruises, and stops. I've gotten my eco score pretty high, not to brag, but I've seen it in the 70s, which is pretty sick. I don't know what happens when I get to 100, but what I do know is the better I get that score, the more miles per gallon I get. But yeah, pretty much everything about the rest of this car is designed around that efficiency. It's aerodynamic enough that it slips through the air. It's got tires that have a low rolling resistance. It doesn't have these sticky, grippy tires. That's actually against efficiency in this case. So if you're looking for a reason why someone would buy a hybrid today, it's because they're not trying to charge a huge battery every night in their garage or rely on the grid or rely on finding public chargers. It's because they just want better gas mileage and they want to spend less, not zero, but less on gas today. But you already know, these cars are obviously very utility focused, therefore people who just are going places, right? But what if you're more after the ultimate driving machine, something a little more versatile than you can spend a little more money and get something like this? All right, so this car starts at about $100,000 a little over and this car is a hybrid for versatility. So the idea is this is a BMW 750E. There's a bunch of vehicles in this class, but yeah, you've spent enough money now at this point that you can reap the benefits of both gas and electric. So this hybrid system has a bit more hardware to accomplish two different goals. So there's a three liter straight six engine making around 300 horsepower and a medium-sized 14.4 kilowatt hour larger battery, powering a roughly 200 horsepower electric motor, so you're totaling around 500 horsepower. So once again, it can drive using both gas and electric, just like the Toyota. But now there's enough battery capacity that you can also drive fully electric at totally normal everyday driving speeds up to like 30 miles on a charge without ever turning on the gas engine. Also, unlike the Corolla, this is a plug-in hybrid so you can directly plug the car into a wall to replenish the battery and just keep driving around on electric as long as you want to with zero gas use. So it does everything the Toyota does, but more. I do feel like plug-in hybrids at this moment in time are the one that make the most sense for the most people that I see driving them. Because if you have a short commute, let's say you have a 10 mile commute every day and you just plug in at a charger at work or in your garage every night or during work in the daytime, you can just straight up never pay for gas again and drive it just like an electric car. But on the off-chance, you do need to drive further, go for a road trip or just do something more than your normal 10 mile commute. You have all the benefits of a gas car. Thankfully, these hybrids also have one crucial piece of the electric car, which is regenerative braking, which means it's going to be able to recuperate a lot of the energy once I've gotten up to speed and start filling up the battery as I'm driving. So there's a little graph on the dash you can see here, which means as I accelerate and I take energy out of the battery, it goes up. But as I decelerate, it's actually blending and friction braking with regenerative braking. And if I drive around like this long enough, especially if I go down hills and brake a lot, I will actually start adding to the charge of this battery too. But you know how electric cars also have that party trick of instant torque available at any RPM and any speed? Well, the hybrid should benefit a little bit from that too. So because this motor is powerful enough and the battery is big enough to provide the voltage, yes, in the sportiest mode, this car also, when you floor it, gets that initial hit from the electricity and then follows with the surge of the rest of the power from the gas engine. Oh, and one of the things I say a lot on the autofocus channel where I've said before is there are certain types of cars that are best to go electric. And because of how much batteries weigh, cars that are already heavy are the best ones to go electric. So like this is a big four door luxury is to Dan. There is no attempt at making this a small car. It's huge. It's got lots of space. It's soft. It's cushy. This is a great type of car to go electric, which is why the I7 is good. But yeah, there are lots of other versions of this, the RAV4 hybrid, the Toyota Prius Prime hybrid, also lots of other plug-in hybrids. Yeah, if I would have recommend one version for more people, like this you still get all of the nice, plushy suspension and all of the tech in the car and all the screens and the way it drives. It's the same thing, but more accessible. You don't have to have a plug in your garage. So all that is fun. That's, I get it. It's versatile. This is why they call it the ultimate driving machine. But you can always spend more. You can always spend more. And when you do, you end up in the territory of specialists. And this is definitely a specialist. Just give me a second. One second. Just one more. Okay. Close that. I've just got eyes for you. No other could and chant me. So this car costs two and a half million dollars. And it's a hybrid purely for performance, which I mean, you could probably tell just by looking at it, but also by the fact that I'm sitting in the middle of the car right now, I have to get used to this. This is the McLaren Speedtail. Okay. So McLaren has done this a few times. One center driver seat, two passenger seats, and just a whole lot of calibration for me for this insane driving position. But yeah, this thing is a hybrid. It's technically a hybrid. So this hybrid system is pretty crazy. It's very focused on literally just going as fast as physically possible, which is just about maximizing power and minimizing weight. So there's already a twin turbo four liter V8 engine pushing out 750 plus horsepower, but then they've also designed a special small but super high powered 1.6 kilowatt hour battery that powers a single electric motor by itself that generates an extra 300 more horsepower. So the total is now over a thousand horsepower. And that motor is basically just being used to help spin the wheels even faster than the engine by itself could. There is no electric only mode. There is no situation where the gas engine ever shuts off. There are no efficiency goals here. This is actually really similar to the turbocharged hybrid setups you literally see in Formula I today. It's just about going fast. So here's a couple of those hilariously overengineered pieces of this car. First of all, this is the only car I've ever actually driven that's shipped with cameras instead of side view mirrors for even better aerodynamics of course. They've also got the electrocromic glass roof tint and windshield tint instead of moving fabric pieces. But then also the active arrow on the back of this car is not just like regular pivoting parts or spoilers or anything like that, but it's literally bending the carbon fiber bodywork and all of the paint and coatings with it up and down when you're under breaking to assist with slowing down. That's insane if you can see what's happening here. And this is also the only car I've ever seen with a wireless charger. That's right. The McLaren Speedtail wireless charges. So the battery is at the bottom of the car and it's small enough that if the driver doesn't park exactly over the right spot in their garage, it's not a huge deal because again, it's a small battery. It shouldn't take too long and inductive charging has never been particularly efficient, but it'll eventually work. And no, I don't think that this would fly for any fully electric car today. Everything about the outside of this car is designed. It's sculpted to just cut through the air and that's how it does zero to 186 miles an hour faster than a Bugatti Shear-On and 250 miles an hour in a straight line. Now, I'm going to let you in on a little secret about these super, super fast electric cars. They need a huge battery to realistically make that happen, right? Let's take Tesla Model S Plaid, for example, a thousand horsepower, crazy high power output from the battery. But in order to do that, they need to give it this huge 100 kilowatt hour battery. So that when you export all that power, you don't just drain the battery super quickly, you can keep driving like a normal person. So that's why you have these super high horsepower electric cars, but they always come with the sacrifice of weight. They're always heavy, the lucid air, it's fighting its weight, the EV6 GT, it's fighting how heavy it is. With a super car like this, it's not fully electric all the time. So they're willing to put in a tiny battery that exports a ton of power and basically drains it in seconds. So I'm going to show you something with this real quick. Right now, I have 100% of my battery. I'm going to do just a quick little pull and see just what a couple of seconds of electric assisted acceleration will do. Way down to 74% battery. Just from that little acceleration, 100 to 74. And now it's already, it's going right back up to 100. It's almost 100 again because I'm driving and recouping that energy. And now it's 100. This is super high tech stuff and it actually has a lot of parallels to what we see in Formula 1. Believe it or not, those Formula 1 cars that we're watching on TV today, those are small, turbocharged hybrid powertrains. So kind of want to do that again. That's what the F1 cars are doing out there. They're recovering energy as they break and they are spending energy when they accelerate. And I guess that's the difference between this and the Rimmack Nevera. You remember, you probably have seen the video I did with the quickest electric car on the world, the Rimmack Nevera, which yes, does have a big heavy battery. It weighs like 5,000 pounds, like a Model S. The crazy thing about that car and that's an anomaly is that it has four electric motors. Which you can kind of think of as being treated like gears, but not really. This will have a higher top speed simply because it just keeps gearing up, seven speed gearbox, and it pulls all the way through up to 250 miles an hour. If you want a hybrid supercar, you can kind of have both fast and quick in the same car. This is fast and quick. I mean, it's not razor sharp, fully electric quick, but it's close. And it's, yeah, it's the fastest. It's one of the fastest cars you can possibly build. Yeah, so I guess my point here with the whole video is, yes, I still fully believe electrification is the future at every level of cars. But in the meantime, it's pretty clear that hybrids make a lot of sense. And then right on our noses the whole time. That's about it. I got your driver's speed, though."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,Do Bad Reviews Kill Companies?,QztFpzKsdeA,2024-04-16T23:34:43Z,PT13M28S,4241379,235601,18793,"['MKBHD', 'product reviews', 'worst product', 'worst car', 'worst review', 'bankrupt', 'negative review']"," Alright, I review a lot of products. I've talked about hundreds, maybe thousands of products at this point. But as many videos as I've made about products, there are way more products out there in the world that exists. So the process of selecting which products to even review in the first place is like an art form to itself. Most products are just, they're fine. Like they exist, they get made, they're fine, whatever. So they have to reach a certain level of interest or being really good to even be considered for a review or sometimes really, really bad. So there's been a lot of interesting discourse lately on this topic. There will be some negative reviews and then a company will eventually go out of business and then the internet poses the question, do bad reviews kill companies? Do bad reviews kill companies or do bad products kill companies? I do have a lot of thoughts. So two of the biggest examples that have been pointed to, especially on Twitter, were the Fisker Ocean review that I did and the Humane AI pin from a couple days ago. So the Fisker saga was pretty well documented, but in case you missed it, I reviewed a car, had a pretty horrible experience with it, documented it, published their review on the Auto Focus channel, and then a few months later, the entire company appears to be on life support, like likely filing for bankruptcy soon. And now this startup Humane, you know, they dropped their first product, this pin, I review it, it's not super positive. A lot of people are saying the same thing and I don't even think Humane is going anywhere by the way, but I think there is some pretty simple logic we can use to decipher what the real danger is to these companies, which is do you still get a bunch of negative reviews and then die as a company if the product is actually really good? But you know, let's back up for a second. What is a review? Little pet peeve in mine is I think people misuse or overuse that word a lot, but a review is just somebody uses the product and then just delivers their impressions on whether they think it's any good or not, how well it actually worked and if they're honest to opinion is if it's good, then that's the review, if it's bad, that's the review, that's basically it. And so I've been an advocate of good independent reviews for what feels like forever now. But the thing about reviews is if they're not honest, then they're basically useless. I really strongly feel like everything that comes from a review, all the consequences and everything that comes around it, everything in the world of an ecosystem of reviews depends on the review being truthful and actually honest about things. So I'll just give an example. I've told this story before, but years ago, I remember I reviewed the first razor phone when it came out. So razor gaming company, they make lots of stuff. They're getting into smartphones for the first time. So they made a phone that appeals to the same target demographic of gamers. So you know how to bunch of upsides and downsides, obviously gaming focus features. So it's got like front facing speakers and a high refresh rate. The battery is pretty big, but also the camera was weak and I specifically, I remember the vibration motor was horrible. And I remember calling it out, I remember saying this. Also the vibration motor in this phone, trash, straight trash. I'm going to call myself so you can hear this. It sounds broken, but it sounded that way out the box since day one. So that is the razor phone. Just one of the worst vibration motors I've ever experienced in a new phone. So okay fast forward a year, right? I'm at a briefing. It's in New York City. It's for the razor phone too. And so they're walking me and some other people through this new phone they've made and they've got a bunch of changes that's got a glossy back. They added why I was charging now. The logo glows and like the speakers are better and all this stuff and they're talking us through it. And then the guy turns to me and he says, and Marquez, you got to try the new vibration motor in this phone. And it's such a niche thing, but I'd sure enough I try it and it's way better. And that's to me what, that's a big part of what reviews are all about. That honest feedback turned into actually action for the company to make it better. So people who bought the first one knew what they were getting into and people who bought the second one actually benefited from that. So that's number one, honesty obviously super important. But the second thing is these reviews are also definitely for the people that are watching them and consuming them. So you've probably been in the situation when you're about to buy something and you just want to double check. So you hop on YouTube, you search it up, watch a couple videos about the product just to make sure you're not missing anything and then you either decide on the moment or later that day like, okay, yeah, I'm definitely going to buy it. We've all been there. That's the reason that's exactly how this YouTube channel started. Like my first ever tech video was reviewing a laptop. But specifically, I bought the laptop with my allowance money in high school and I found a Windows Media Center remote in the PCI slot that wasn't in any of the other reviews. So the first thing I decided to do was talk through it in a video so that anyone else who bought the laptop after me would know about it. So you're thinking about buying a thing, you watch a couple reviews of the thing, you learn everything you need to know, boom, success. But here's where it gets a little bit interesting. I do have a bit of an extra dimension on my hands with these videos because I know that there's no way that every single person watching a review of every single product is one of those people who was considering buying it. I get that comment actually in person all the time. I watch the reviews even though I'm not buying any of this stuff. So I know that a lot of people, in fact, most people watching these videos are actually just here to watch an interesting, informative, good video in general, an entertaining video. And so the way that I satisfy those things is much more subjective, I think. Like everyone has a different way. They do it. Everyone has a different target demographic. But that's a little bit of a new dimension. So then I think if we go back to the original question, so can a video kill a company? I'll use the humane and fiscar examples specifically. The fiscar ocean was a terrible car. It is a terrible car. I've reviewed about 40, 50 different cars in the past few years, made videos about many of them. This is the first one where I genuinely couldn't wait to be done driving it. Like it just had tons of problems, bugs, missing features, safety issues. Like it's just bad, right? So I review the thing. I give people what I feel is a fair assessment that also doubles as a warning not to buy this bad car. So hopefully it's entertaining and informative to the majority of people who weren't thinking about buying the car, but also that it is as honest as possible with the people who are. And maybe a week or two later, the company's stock price is plummeting to an all-time low and they appear to be like filing for bankruptcy. Queue the internet going nuts, which I guess I get it. Like obviously it makes a nice headline like, oh, this review came out and it killed this company. This review bankrupted all of fiscar maybe. Like there was a whole morning brew thread on how fiscar handled this video so poorly that they're now going to go bankrupt because of it. Also there were a whole stock investment theme channels saying this was like a paid, promoted attack against the fiscar stock price. Like it got pretty crazy. But did one review kill the entire company? I would say to zoom out a bit. I would really, I think it's important to zoom out a bit actually. First of all, I was not the only one to review the car and I even close. And so yes, the stock price did drop after my video, but the stock was in free fall for many, many months before my video too. And if you zoom out on YouTube or in the car review space in general, I was far from the only person saying these things about the car for all of these months. Many other reviewers had been having a plethora of issues, even stuff that I didn't have with this thing. Actually I feel like that might be the easiest way to tell if a review is honest or not. Like we're all reviewing the same product. Basically, if we all have the same thing. So we're all going to find a lot of the same things. We're all eventually going to have a lot of the same upsides, downsides. If there are issues, they may eventually surface. Well, yeah, they're probably going to agree with each other, a bunch of honest reviews. They'll all say a lot of the same stuff. Oh, and also in the US, the stock price, there's this thing where if a stock, what is it? If it's below a dollar for however many days in a row, then they'll get a warning that they may be delisted and they have six months to get the stock price back up over a dollar. And Fisker had just received that notice right around the same time that might, I think right before my video came out actually. And if you're an investor, you're looking at that, that's the type of stuff that really tanks the stock price if you're asking me. And if you're asking me personally, I literally don't care with the stock prices of any company of any product I review. I just don't care. And so if I'm talking about a product that will never have anything to do with what I say about the product, and I hope that's not true about other people either. I actually don't even have to say this. I'm not invested in any companies that I cover. It's just a matter of trying to make an informative, educational, and honest video review. That's my goal. My only goal is to do that. And I don't have any duty to any of the companies whose products I cover. It is only to the people watching the videos. So now, okay, fast forward to pretty recently, the Humane AI pin comes out. A lot of the same stuff, right? Like this pin has a lot of missing promises, the things it does, it doesn't actually do super well. The battery life is bad, it overheats, the laser projector is kind of bad. Like the list just goes on and on. I try to be as fair as possible and as informative as possible. But I'll also absolutely not about to sugarcoat or leave anything out to protect any company's $700 device with a monthly subscription. Not into that. But yet, even still, there are some threads blowing up saying, it's extra bad what I did to this poor company. And maybe you could argue, since this is the biggest channel that covered it, maybe there's some extra impact there. But again, I would say to zoom out. I just zoom out again. I am not, I was not the first actually even to cover the Humane pin, but I'm also far from the only one to talk about it. And even a little inside baseball, when a product comes out that's this notable or this bad, which isn't very often, a lot of reviewers like that, it's a very, very, very, very, it's stressful. You want to make sure you get everything right. A lot of us are literally trading notes and like trying to figure out, like, when mine died in two hours and overheated on my chest without doing anything, I thought it was like an issue with mine. And I was texting a couple of others and sure enough, they're having the same things that happened to them. So we're all trying to be as thorough as possible and making sure reviews are truthful. And so that's how you get a bunch of truthful reviews. You could argue, and I think the guy on Twitter did, that the packaging was too click-bady, and I totally get that. But I also stand by our title and thumbnail, and especially the end of the title. But keep in mind the dimension that most of the people who see this in their feed and their subscription box have never heard of the Humane AI pen. This will be the first time they hear about it, and they click on it, hopefully. And then they're delivered with a thoughtful, well-considered, balanced, and honest, and entertaining, and informative video that happens to be a review. So look, I've reviewed a lot of bad products in my day. You might remember some of them, you might remember the Dyson headphones or the Red Hydrogen One, or the Pixel Slate, or the HTC U Ultra. The list goes on. But one thing has definitely been clear and consistent throughout all of this, which is anytime the company goes under, you don't get those bad reviews without the product being bad to begin with, obviously. I have a massive amount of respect and appreciation for people and groups of people who are actually making new stuff like building products. That's the hard part at the end of the day, and we get to get a whole bunch of new exciting things that might change the world, and that's really exciting. But my reviews, technically, are not for them. All that any honest review actually does is just accelerate whatever was already going on. Think of it that way. Okay, thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed... For Now,TitZV6k8zfA,2024-04-14T22:41:37Z,PT25M4S,7819612,233430,19391,"['Humane pin', 'Humane AI pin', 'AI pin', 'MKBHD', 'bad product', 'worst product']"," Alright, so this is the Humane AI pin. It is a brand new product and a really, really interesting form factor of an ultra futuristic wearable computer. So in a time of all these crazy gadgets and Vision Pro and wearable glasses, it's so sick that we get so many genuinely new first generation products like this to give a shot. Unfortunately, it's also the new worst product. I think I've ever reviewed in its current state. There's just so many things bad about it. It's so bad in fact that I think it's actually kinda distracting to like understand what the point of the device is as we go through it. So I'm gonna have to separate it out for this video. First, I'm gonna tell you what it is and what it's supposed to do. And then I'll tell you what my experience has actually been using it. So this thing is a small wearable computer with an AI inside that can help you throughout your day. It's about the size of a large watch. It has a camera and a microphone and can interact with the world around you. But in case you can't use that as input, there's also a touch pad and a projector inside with this super new style of gesture control with the projection on your hand. It costs $700 plus a $24 a month subscription plan for the data that comes with it and all the services and all the online storage. But yeah, $700 plus a subscription. It's already a fun start. But so one of the big things off the top is this does not pair to your smartphone at all. This is its own standalone device with its own internet connection, with its own phone number. And so this little AI assistant just goes everywhere with you. It's always connected and that's, you can choose how much or how little to use it alongside your smartphone. So on its face, maybe that's kind of a cool idea at least. Like the idea is you talk to it like a person. It answers questions. It gives you historical facts or personalized recommendations or helps you out with things like brainstorming or remembering things. It can make phone calls and send text messages, a ton of stuff. The unfortunate reality, those, this thing is too much of a pain to use to actually want to do most of that stuff alongside your phone, but we'll get there. What's your favorite phone? What's your favorite phone? All right, let me actually start with the hardware. This little thing is the build of this thing is actually impressive. Like genuinely, I think if you're looking for a reason to feel like you're not getting ripped off, the hardware packaging actually kind of accomplishes that. Like this pin is solid. It's aluminum, it's dense feeling. There's three colors actually. There's all matte black, which is the cheapest one or for a hundred bucks more. You can get white or this black and silver one that I'm using. And then there's a lot of sensors packed up there. There's a camera, there's microphones, there's lights. There's a tiny class two laser projector. So this whole thing is like really densely packed. And then the magnets also, that connect everything are super strong. So the back of this pin is called a booster. It's another battery. So it's got its own internal battery. But then once you attach it to your clothes, it cleverly through your clothes magnetizes there, makes a nice sound when you do, and that's how you get it attached. So you get two of these boosters. And since there's the internal battery, you can literally hot swap between them so the thing stays alive, very clever. And then it also comes with this extremely well-made and also very, very reflective charging case. So you can pop it in there or just your battery in there, keep it topped off. That charges by USB type C. This thing is nice. And it also comes with this desktop charging puck where you can magnetize in the battery, or the whole thing, the pin and the booster at the same time. So that is a lot of charging and battery-related accessories, but they all come with it. And this pin, it's also got these lights up at the top here that light up anytime you're doing anything. And there's also a small pin light notification for when there's something waiting for you. So between the weight of the parts and the strength of the magnets, how it all slaps together, like you can tell that a lot of effort was put into the craftsmanship of this product, which I very much appreciate. It's the best part of the pin by a lot. Alright. Okay, I want you to forget about the smartphone in your pocket for a second. Do I just for a minute, just pretend that doesn't exist, ignore it, right? This little pin can do a lot of stuff is very helpful. So again, think of this thing as an AI assistant that's like by your side all the time with you. So you can ask it things. It doesn't have a wake word. It only turns the mic on and listens when you touch it. So you can go, how tall is the Empire State Building? And then when you let go, it starts sending that query off to the crowd. The Empire State Building is 1,454 feet tall to the tip. The cloud, and it gets you an answer, which is great. And it also is multimodal. So that means it can look at the camera and see things and interact with the world around you. So look and tell me what you see. So it'll scan the room, use the cloud again. That little noise was it taking a little image, sending out image to the cloud, analyzing it, getting it back, then deciding what to tell me. We're sitting in front of a camera and a laptop. The camera is on a tripod and pointed at you. The laptop is open and you are looking at it. There are three pictures of dogs on the wall behind you. There is a window to the left of the camera. There is a boom mic on the table in front of you. There is a red carpet on the floor. Great. The camera can also take pictures or up to 15 second videos, which it auto uploads while charging. It can also remember things you tell it to remember. And all these things will show up in the humane center. So that's like this online web portal for all things connected to the pin. There's no app. It's just a website. So there you can see a whole history of who you've called and texted and what you've listened to and what answers it gave to your most recent requests and all the things you told it to remember. It is pretty well rounded. I think probably it's it's best tech demo feature though is the translate back and forth. You got a two finger gesture. You can go don't this style of biblioteca. Where's the library? So it auto detects the language, translates to English and the person who speaks back can translate back as long as you hold down the pin and listen to them. Pretty cool. This is all voice stuff though. So if at any point you're in a loud area or a very private area and you don't want to interact out loud with your voice, that's where this projector comes in. So it seems crazy, but you activate it like that and then you just hold your finger out your whole palm and it becomes a projector screen for the laser projector built into the pin. So it takes a little practice, but eventually you get used to holding your hand up in just the right spot. And then the UI gets projected in this green 720p mini screen on your hand. So you basically use your hand. Try to be as flat as possible and then to interact with it, there are some movement gestures. So there's a time of flight sensor that keeps track of movement and you move your hand around kind of like rolling a marble around in your hand to select something then pinch to select. You can then make a fist to go back and then you literally push forward to move deeper into a menu. So this is like a 3D UI you have to learn. This is obviously very brand new for people, but I think to be fair, it is pretty intuitive. I think if you get a quick 60 second lesson, you kind of already have learned all the things you need. When you first connect the booster to the pin, you can unlock it and unlocking it with my pin is like this move your hand through space to select the numbers thing. It's literally like moving back and forth through a roll of decks of real numbers. So it's one of those like borderline magic things where the first time you see it, you kind of just get it and it clicks even if it is a little fidgety and a little bit inaccurate and kind of slow, but that gets us into the review. So unfortunately this thing is that it almost everything it does, basically all the time. Where do I even start? So I guess first of all, okay, it's supposed to just answer questions, right? It can kind of do that sometimes, but one, it's often slow because most of these requests go to the cloud and come back and there's just a long wait and two, it's often wrong because AI still can hallucinate and there are still issues with it just not understanding correctly or just saying the wrong thing. And that's not even mentioning server timeouts if you have a poor internet connection, which happens to me all the time in this studio. So when they do most of the demos like on their websites and in their videos, they'll ask a question and then they'll let go and keep talking to fill the silence so it's not awkward as you wait for an answer and realize how long it is, but even on this fast studio wife out here, who designed the Washington Monument? Finding Designer. The Washington Monument was designed by Robert Mills, a prominent 19th century American architect from South Carolina. The construction was eventually completed by Thomas. So you can just hold your hand up to put your answer on your hand and interrupt that it's talking so much, but even that was like a pretty good performance for the AI pin and ideal fast Wi-Fi conditions. But there are many, many times when I feel like it's way slower and it seems like it goes to the internet for almost everything. I mean, there's a few queries I guess might be local, like what time is it? 1142 am. Like that's pretty fast, the fast, the battery life, it can tell me that pretty fast, but it feels like basically everything else is just shoveling it off to the cloud, not competing on the device, and it takes a while. But it's also just wrong all the time. Like I remember asking it days before the solar eclipse when the next eclipse was, and it said 2044, I asked it, what's some good Asian food in the area? And over and over again, it thought I said, what's the best ash for some reason? One is the next net's game. Finding next net's game. The next Brooklyn net's game is on Sunday, April 14th, but no specific opponent or location is provided. I just googled it, it says it's the 76ers, so that's kind of weird. What's the traffic to the Empire State Building from here? Finding directions. Use the voice command feature of AI pin to ask for traffic information to the Empire State Building, and it will provide you with the details you need. I did. This stuff happens all the time, but then speaking of battery life, really bad, and inconsistent, which is annoying, so it's already kind of bad enough that you have another device that you also have to charge every single day. But with this, it's actually more than that. You have to constantly babysit the battery and swap out boosters and charge this thing and keep it charged multiple times per day. So like I said before, you get two of these things that come with it, and I've had a pin nuke through the entire booster battery in two hours while not really doing much of anything. I've also had it last like four hours while doing a whole bunch of photos and videos and requests and laser stuff, and it's also just like constantly warm the whole time, just all the time, which is a little bit concerning. I'll also say multiple times in various situations. I've had it just overheat for seemingly no reason, and tell me to wait a while for it to cool down. I think the heat problem is also amplified because of the gap created by whatever fabric is between the booster and the product that it is actively inductively charging. You know, it is a lot of very impressive engineering, but wireless charging is notoriously inefficient and loses energy via heat, and that's what's happening in here all the time. So just the fact that it's warm, just this warm puck on my chest all day was just enough to never quite forget that I'm wearing it. Well, that and the weight. Look, it's well made, like I said, it's really impressive hardware, but it's just a little, I mean, you see that little sag? It's just a little too heavy. In the same way that Vision Pro is just a bit too heavy when you're wearing the thing, you just want to make it as light as possible. That's why a lot of this stuff is made of plastic. So when you decide to go aluminum, instead, yes, just a little too heavy. I feel like humane in a lot of their videos, they've got all these thick fabrics and like heavy jackets. So it doesn't really pull down and sag nearly as much, but if you wear some lighter weight materials like I do, especially when it gets warm outside, this is really going to start to be noticed. And yes, there are some optional accessories that are lighter weight, but you never quite forget about it. This pin cannot set a timer. This pin cannot set an alarm. This notification light they put up at the corner here, it's there and it works, but it is basically out of my peripheral, my field of view, so I almost never see it. And you know, they also chose this corner for the light, which means it's designed to be worn on this half of the body, which is fine. And you get used to it there, but that's also exactly where most seat belts go in the US anyway. So not their fault, just another annoying thing about using it. The photos look pretty bad and the videos look even worse. They're squareish in aspect ratio, very noisy, and they max out at 15 seconds. The hub that everything sinks with for me just randomly stops working and I have to refresh it to get it to work again. The projector as impressive as a technical achievement as it is, it's just not very readable. It's not particularly bright outdoors and it gets dimmer the further from your hand it is because of physics. And unless I knew what those words were saying, I really can't read very much. And there are no apps. There are just our no apps. So when you first sign up with your human account, you get to sync with four accounts. There are your Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Title. So the first three are basically for your contacts, and then the last one, Title is the exclusive music partner. So there is no Uber access. There is no Spotify access. There's no WhatsApp. There's no calendar, no Gmail. None of that stuff is just it doesn't have I can't book a flight. I can't buy something on Amazon. It just will not do any of that stuff that I just do on my phone. So I know I've said like a bunch of the downsides and the problems this device has, but I really genuinely think the biggest problem this pin is going to have is that smartphones are kind of OP. Like that's the number one thing I've reminded myself from the week of using this pin, trying to get it to do stuff is that smartphones are not going anywhere anytime soon. And I think a lot of the comments online have already picked up on this even without testing and using the pin, which is okay, there seems like a lot of overlap between what this is and what a smartphone can do. But everything that this pin does, a modern smartphone does better and faster and easier and in higher quality and just better in every way. Like your smartphone obviously takes better pictures and videos and you can frame things more easily. Of course, a phone can call and text people more easily. You can use it in more places, loud places, private places, use it with literally any outfit. Also a phone like you can quickly google things, it's faster to message people back. And of course it can email people and use all kinds of app experiences. Do you know what happens when you try to just send someone a picture from the AI pin? You already know how to do it on your phone. With the AI pin, okay, you take the picture, then you either try this with your voice or you pull up the picture, which is just a green 720p jpeg on your hand. I guess that's a good enough preview, sure. You go to send it, you pick your contact or type in the whole phone number with the gestures. Eventually you go to send and it has its own internet connection and it sends a link to view the picture in the humane web portal. Like the difference in how easy, how frictionless that is here versus here, it's not even close. And there are honestly many times where I would be trusting this pin. Like I'm reviewing it, I'm living that life, I'm using it and I'd ask it something and I would wait so long and my phone would just be sitting right there where I could just pick it up and google the answer and the time it takes me to get hopefully the right answer on the pin. It's just phones are OP. Look and tell me what this is. All right, I'll just do this, I guess. It's a cyber truck. The photo is of a cyber truck and electric the cup truck is by Tesla. Yep, also I got to say when I say phones are OP, like screens in your hand, so sick. Just for the last like 10% of any UI, like you can get almost all the way there with just your voice interaction, but let's say you call an Uber and you say take me to the studio from an Uber, even if it could do that, which you can't, but let's say it could. And as you're waiting, you're like I'm going to just go grab a snack from the Starbucks on the corner. How do you adjust your pickup location with this? Ah, just that friction of I could just do it in two seconds on my phone or buying something online as another one. I've seen a lot of demos or someone's like plan me a trip to Europe, plan me an expedition. I don't even want to buy detergent online on this because I need to check all the ratings and the titles and make sure I'm ordering the right one. I do not trust that with just my voice. But I think most critically for the AI assistant part, I actually love the idea of a virtual assistant that you can talk to like a human. Like this is something we've been chasing for years with Google assistant and Siri and Alexa. And now with this new form factor of you know, a little AI in a box that can be with you everywhere, maybe that can deliver even better on that specific promise. But the thing about a good assistant is it needs to know everything about you. That's that's even true with a human assistant. Like it needs to know your schedule, it needs to know where you go every day, it needs to know who you talk to, where your preferences are personally and for products like it needs to know everything about you. And your smartphone already knows a lot of things about you. But this is a standalone device that doesn't talk to your phone and so it doesn't know any of the things about you that your phone knows. So just from that, it's already at such a massive disadvantage for the smartphone for being helpful. I mean you can you can do it. I did fully immerse yourself for several days straight until it's remember everything and call people text people from it. But it's still it will always have that gap. And that's not even mentioning this. Like I said, it has its own phone number. And so if you text people and call people from this, yeah, it can summarize all of your messages from the day and all that stuff from these conversations. But it doesn't see any of these conversations. So if you're texting here, this is not the same thread that gap is always going to be there. So I guess that begs the question, why didn't they just make this connect to your phone? Everyone has a phone. That's the question that I think a lot of people are wondering. And I think this is my theory, but I think humane wants this thing to eventually be a very powerful standalone device someday. And in order to get it to that future, they can't set the precedent now of connecting it to your phone because that means I have to remove that feature in the future and they don't want to do that. So this device, as it exists today, is hamstrung by its ideal future version of itself. It's like Vision Pro. Like I talked about it in the Vision Pro review. It doesn't actually pair to your iPhone in any way. It's its own standalone computer. And of course, Apple sees down the road. That could just be like a little pair of smart glasses. You don't need an iPhone to use that. But now today, this thing is a victim of its future ambition. It was really hard to come up with a title for this video. But I will say at one point my working title for this was this product is either the dumbest thing ever or I'm an idiot because yes, it's really, really, really, really bad now. But every once in a while, and I mean a while, I would use it and it would do exactly what it's supposed to do quickly. And I would get it. And I'd really feel like that is that's how it's supposed to feel. And then I do another request and it would remind me of reality. But here's an example, right? I've said a thousand times like you're my best ideas. Golden Rule, they always show up when I can't write them down. Like when I'm about to fall asleep or I'm in a shower or driving, right? So I'm using the pin. I'm driving to the studio and I have an idea. I'm not trying to write it down on my phone while driving or pull over. But I had the pin. So I'm driving and I just remind me of this cool ABC outro idea for the humane review. And I just kept driving and it wrote it down and it's saved. And when I go check the humane. The outro idea for the humane review has been saved. Voice is kind of annoying. But now that's up in the humane AI center. So when I arrive at the studio, that thing that I told it to remember is sitting there waiting for me. That was nice. Or the other thing, the unique first person videos. I could put it in the center of my chest and take videos. I would never want to distract myself while driving, taking a video. But you know, even though the quality is not great, that's the most frictionless version of that along with smart glasses. That's great. And I think number one on top of all of this is if you ask me like, who should buy this device right now? I mean, nobody should buy this device right now. But if there's one person who would most consider it, it's the person that wants to spend as little time as possible with a screen in their hands. Like as little time as possible on their phone. That's me sometimes. I don't want to doom scroll the second I pull my phone out my pocket. For that person, if they want that at the expense of everything else, this device represents just a glimmer of hope. For that future. Now the problem of course is with this device, there's just so much more friction and fumbling and annoyance that comes with it that you don't want to do it, even though you would accomplish the goal of less screen time and living in the moment. But yeah, that's that's the issue with it. I literally had a moment like we did a shoot in Ohio the other day, which was like a travel day. And I woke up in the morning and I thought like, I don't want to deal with this pin today. Like I have driving. So the seat belt's going to be annoying and then we're going to go to the airport and then probably got to take it off through the metal detector and then put it on again, which means I have to log in with the pin again and just all this and I just was like, I don't want to have to charge this seven times like I don't want to wear it today. So I skipped it. And you should probably skip this product too. And never buy a product based on the future promise of updates to it. Obviously, this is a product that has a long way to go and there's a team behind it and look, I got to say, as a brand new product and a team trying to make something new, that I respect. I respect the attempt because we don't get a lot of totally new stuff. But yeah, this is a this is a long way to go. They do have a roadmap actually. I'll say they've shared it. There's some decent stuff on there, including number sharing, but that also has no date and no other information. So I'll just say, good luck. Godspeed. Thanks for watching. Catch you next one. Peace."

Or if I build new headphones and my headphones only work with my cable, that's vertical integration. Now, if I build a new smartwatch and my smartwatch only works with my smartphone, be careful. That might be illegal. That's a bit of an over-simplification, but let's talk about it. So, this is a developing story and we'll continue to develop for years, but I feel like it all comes down to something that I've at least noticed in talking to all these big companies, all these very public multi-billion dollar companies. They always have two reasons for any public-facing statement that they make. There's the reason for the public, and then there's the real reason. So, there was just some news this past week of the US Department of Justice suing Apple, saying that they are an illegal monopoly in the United States, the iPhone specifically. Now, whenever there's legal proceedings, obviously things get very complicated and I won't even pretend to be diving into this at a super deep level, but this is also interesting to me because of all the stuff with the things that we talk about every day, with just smartphones and gadgets. And, of course, this is a pretty US-specific thing, like they obviously are being sued by the US, but also their dominance. Apple, the iPhone is the most popular in the US. So, I think these are some numbers we should keep in mind. In the US, the iPhone is at like 60% market share, and it's even way higher up near 90% with young people. Like, it is ridiculously dominant. But worldwide, the iPhone is at about 25% market share. So, the iPhone is specifically trending towards a monopoly in the United States. So, here's where it gets really interesting. I would like to live in this analogy for this video, which is you've heard about people describing Apple's ecosystem as a walled garden before. This could not be more true, right? There's this really, really nice, beautiful, luscious garden, and in the middle of that garden is the iPhone, and it has these really tall, thick walls all the way around it. So, in an ideal world, right? You are just picking between different options for a product based on its merits, based on its features. So, you just look at the whole line up and you go, yeah, I like this one the best, and that's how you make your choice, right? Sick. But, with this one, the claim is, Apple is making it really, really difficult once you've chosen theirs to ever switch to anything else. So, with this analogy again, it's really the walls of the garden that we have the issue with. So, I'll give you two examples. So, take the Apple Watch, right? This is one of the examples in the Department of Justice's 88-page PDF that they've submitted. The iPhone and the Apple Watch work perfectly well together and only together. It's a feature, it's by design, that's how they are. So, two parts of that are sketchy. One is the Apple Watch works really well with the iPhone in a way that no other smartwatch can, and two, the Apple Watch does not work with any other smartphone. So, look, I don't think it's a surprise that when Apple built a watch, they gave it all kinds of integrations with the iPhone, so you can see them working perfectly together. You can see and dismiss your notifications, you can reply to messages, track your fitness, you can even use it as a shutter for your iPhone's camera. All these features that they just plug right into the iPhone, they work great. And I think that's even what Apple would tell people they would agree, like this is how we made it so that they work amazingly well together, this is vertical integration, it's awesome. But, there's also the real reason, because the truth is now, if you try to use any other smartwatch with the iPhone, you just don't get nearly as many of those useful features from being super well integrated. If you try to use like a Garmin smartwatch, for example, you don't get the viewfinder for the camera, you don't get the fitness tracking through Apple Fitness, you don't get quick replies, you don't get even image previews to your text messages, you don't even get to choose which apps show you notifications, it's just all or nothing. So, if you choose an iPhone, then next when you're looking for a smartwatch to buy, there's kind of only really one good full-fledged option, which is the Apple Watch. This is also true, by the way, to various degrees with AirPods and AirTags and various other things in Apple's ecosystem, because they all are great when you have an iPhone and work super well with it, but work horribly or not at all when you don't. So, that is part of the, that's the walls around the ecosystem that make it really hard to leave, because if you now want to switch from the iPhone to the Android phone, you're not just switching phones, you have to now get a new phone and a new watch and new headphones and a new tracker and all this stuff, because they all worked so well with the iPhone and so horribly with anything else. So, that is a real barrier to people leaving this ecosystem once they get into it. So, another example is the whole blue bubbles and green bubbles thing that they do. I've already made an entire video about this dynamic, if you haven't already seen it, I'll leave a link below if you want to watch it. But, basically, today, when iPhones message other iPhones, they have tons of features and typing indicators and high-res media and those are blue bubbles and when they message Android phones, it falls back to SMS, which is slow, low-res, unencrypted trash, that is green bubbles. And Apple just refuses to make iMessage work on Android. The Department of Justice actually literally references a video of Tim Cook on stage at a conference where he says this. It's tough not to make it personal, but I can't see my mom certain videos or she can't see me certain videos. And so, we'll be fine. By your mom, I fall. And this is so poetic, just because obviously he's got this smile of like, you guys all know it's true. But also it goes back to what I said at the beginning, which is with any of these public facing decisions, there's the answer that they give the public. And then there's the real reason. You know, originally iMessage was built back in the days where text messages were basically paid per text, like every SMS cost money, hence the green. So iMessage would work over the internet and be unlimited and it would offer way more features and they'd build onto it over time, adding encryption and reactions and typing indicators, all this stuff. And Apple people and Apple themselves would probably all agree like, this is, it's just a thing that Apple built. That's a way better than SMS. Like it's not their fault SMS sucks. They just made a better thing. So yeah, of course, yeah, they're going to build their own version of a thing and it's not illegal to not also develop it for Android. They just made their own thing for the iPhone. But also, Tim Cook's quote, just by your mom and iPhone is the other equally valid point. It's the real reason. There are plenty of internal emails that have surfaced over time with Apple executives openly talking about how giving iMessage to Android would make it easier for people to switch to Android from the iPhone. iMessage is clearly one of the walls of the ecosystem and it's probably one of the biggest, thickest walls. Like ask any young person in the US today, why they use an iPhone. And I think a lot of them would probably tell you something to do with iMessage. So is this stuff that they're doing illegal, I guess is the question, or maybe even another way to phrase it is, is Apple making other products worse or are they making their own products really good and then not letting other things outside the ecosystem have access to those things? It's kind of both, honestly. But the thing is, they're not the only ones doing a lot of this stuff. They are just the ones that happen to be in this pseudo monopoly position right now. Like the Pixel watch, for example, does not work at all with the iPhone. It just works perfectly with Android phones. But is anybody that mad about that? You know, RCS is announced to be coming to the iPhone at some point in 2024, but I can almost guarantee it'll probably still be green bubbles. It will probably be the absolute bare minimum of supporting RCS and they will probably still be delineating very clearly between iPhone to iPhone, iMessage and iPhone to Android, something else. And there's even more to this lawsuit like Apple Pay is another one. How no other services can use the NFC chip on the iPhone. Super apps is another one. Like if you want to look at all this stuff, I will link the best stuff I can find down below. So my take is Apple is technically yet guilty of all these things. They're doing all this stuff. But in the walled garden analogy, it's like they have built up a really, really nice garden. And Apple would say like, look, our garden, it's so green and luscious and beautiful. They've built the most beautiful garden with the most people in it. But they've also built up the biggest walls around that garden. And so Apple would love to say, look, everyone's chosen our garden and they're all staying in our garden. That's how great it is. But even if you saw another greener softer, better garden somewhere else, the walls to escaping to getting to that are just way too high. So it's less that each individual thing that they're doing with the products working well together is illegal. And it's more that they feel like they have to do something about this one company having so much power and control in smartphones, which is here it's essentially a commodity. It's just like a thing that everybody has. So I want to leave you with this. You remember at the beginning when I talked about how Apple's ridiculously dominant in the US and these crazy numbers like 90% of young people. The crazy thing is they're super, super popular here. But as I mentioned, they are not a monopoly anywhere else. And why? Why is that true? How are they so popular here? And they're doing all the same stuff in other places, but they're not monopoly in other places. And so I think of China, for example, China is another huge smartphone market where we chat is kind of like this super super app. It's a huge thing. Like it's messaging, it's payments, it's also calling a taxi and also paying your bills and ordering food, groceries like wechat is everything. So just as long as your phone has wechat, then the rest is kind of doesn't really matter. It's up to you. And so in China, there's this incredibly vibrant innovative landscape of all these smartphone manufacturers competing like crazy like Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, and iPhone is in there too. But they're all just competing ruthlessly with hardware features and with other stuff to try to get your attention to maybe pick their phone. Because it's just what you're into. They all have wechat. So in a market like that, people will buy your phone based on if it's actually better or not. Meaning there's lots of gardens and very few walls around those gardens. That's what a good competitive landscape looks like. Now what would be maybe illegal or a wrong thing to do is if wechat or the makers of wechat of Tencent made a phone, and then they gave their phones special access to certain parts of wechat that suddenly no other phone could get, then monopoly. So this lawsuit and all this legal versus illegal stuff, it's mainly just a way to try to poke some holes and get closer to that level of lower walls and more competition that makes everybody better. Then we're actually competing on innovation again. But it's something that we'll be evolving for a long time over time. So it'll be interesting to keep an eye on. And speaking of things that might be illegal, shout out to Dbrand for sponsoring this video. So you might have heard about, unless you've been living under a rock, you've heard about their grip case by now. So I've got their latest Hydro Dip cases here and I gotta say the name matches it perfectly. You know, these days a lot of phone cases are just kind of boring plastic shells, but with Dbrand, they're kind of playing with some stuff. And these are some crazy colorways and these trippy Hydro Dip patterns. Plus with the Gold Rush one, if you catch under the right light, you'll notice a little low key metallic effect under this matte finish, which is sick. Now in addition to the impact protection that you expect from premium case. Perfect. Grip cases also have what I would consider attention to detail. So that's two things. First of all, these buttons, they're just really clicky. They're nice. They're probably better than the actual phones buttons. But also in general, like we've all eventually dropped a phone, whether it's like out of a car or on your face while watching YouTube video, it happens. Ideally, this case prevents it because it's in the name. It's the grip case. This texture is pretty nice at that. So it's hopefully going to prevent that sort of drop stuff. But in the case you do drop it, then yeah, should be fine. It's good. So yeah, if you're a case person, I would say at least get yourself a nice grip case. I'll leave a link below. But that's it. Thanks for watching this video. And let me know what you think about these features and the iPhone and everything going on with it. And I'll catch you guys in the next video. Peace."

It's not the fact that it weighs over three tons and goes from zero to 60 miles an hour faster than a Corvette. It's not even the way that reflections glare off the stainless steel and can blind people on the highway. No. The most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck is the way it makes other people around you on the road behave. Okay, I genuinely can't tell if the Cybertruck is good looking or not and I'm being completely serious. Like if you just check the comment section online, it's actually mostly negative. Most people are saying it looks horrible, looks like a refrigerator on wheels, it's a disaster of a design. But once you start living with this thing, you drive around with it and you talk to people about it who have never heard of it, they're saying things like this, this is crazy. This is like a movie prop. This sci-fi looks something alien. So there's a lot to it here. First of all, stainless steel and black plastic. That's mostly what you're working with here. And the front, I think it has a good angle to be honest. I'm a sucker for a light bar, but the actual headlights are down here. So they stay out of people's eyes. In general, it's like a square jaw line, no curves, just angles. But the back, the back not so much, you know, it's still technically a bar, yes, but it's a little bit dinkier in my opinion. And also just tons of black plastic in the back, really high tailgate. I'm getting like dump truck vibes from back here. I don't think I am the only one. I just, I don't think the back is its best angle. But if I had to narrow it down, I'm pretty sure the most iconic profile is the side. And the two elements of this truck that really stand out are this slope, these high shoulders, and then the pointy corners on the other side. See, most pickup trucks have basically this general shape. It's the traditional pickup truck look. And so we're not used to seeing this angle right here. And this huge slope right here. It's unusual. It's weird. It's very visually interesting. So I've been living with the Cybertruck for about a month now, well over 1,500 miles. And you notice a couple things. First of all, people, whenever you go park somewhere, always want to come up to you and talk about it. Naturally, I've entertained a lot of these conversations because they're fun. And they usually say two things. One, you'd be surprised how many people have never heard of the Cybertruck. I know for us online people, people watching this video, you're like, how could anyone have not heard of the Tesla Cybertruck? But you'd be shocked. And two, most people just want to know how much does that thing cost? And I got asked that so many times. Eventually, I just started having people guess. And a hundred percent of the people who guessed were too high. People were guessing two 50, 300 K, 180 K, 150 K. They're all way over. But you know, how could they know? They don't know what the rest of the truck is. They've just seen this thing they've never seen for the first time. And so I guess the conclusion is the looks are really distracting people from the rest of what makes the Cybertruck. The Cybertruck. Okay, let's play a little game. I'm going to name a feature. And all you have to do is think about it for a second and think about if you believe it's overrated or underrated. And then I, so who's been driving this truck will tell you the real answer. So first feature, steer by wire. I've seen a few good pieces cover what's actually happening here talking about the complete physical disconnect between the steering wheel you're holding and the wheels that are moving under the truck. Instead, it's a bunch of sensors reacting to your input like a video game controller. But combined with the variable steering ratio and the four wheel steering, this is the most nimble, agile feeling truck that I have ever driven. And I don't think a lot of people realize that. So I'm going underrated. It's one of those things where Tesla definitely didn't have to do this. Like they've made their headlines already with the looks that could just be a model 300. But they went through the extra measures and the extra engineering to ship a full steer by wire system and all the redundancies that come with making it safe. I believe they're the first ones to do this. But the variable steering ratio is really what gives it all of its utility. So at low speeds, the ability to turn really quickly gets dialed up. It's a much more responsive feeling steering wheel. So if I want to turn right here, I only have to give it what half a turn, quarter turn, and I'm fully maneuvering. The way you can pull into parking spots and make 90 degree turns and everything is a total game changer. But then at highway speeds, it softens that ratio a lot. So you have a little bit of steering input to sort of glide left and right between different lanes. It's much more subtle. You kind of need that. But then on top of that, throw in the four wheel steering. So four wheel steering is not new. Lots of vehicles have done it. But the amount of steer that you get from these rear wheels is pretty dramatic to the point where you can look in the mirrors and see those wheels turning. And this can also be adjusted with software. But that really lets this huge truck basically pivot around a much smaller axis. The steering ratio now, I think, is at the same steering circle as a Model S. But it feels really, really impressive just because of how big the actual vehicle is. It definitely takes some getting used to it. You can't ignore that fact. But once you get used to it, you literally feel like when you go back to like an F-150 or any other truck where you have all this hand over hand steering to do the K-turns, that feels weird. It feels archaic. It feels like you shouldn't have to do that. So again, Tesla definitely didn't have to do that. But just the way you can drive it like a smaller car and really point the nose, I don't know. It's definitely underrated. All right, next feature. Bulletproof stainless steel. Overrated or underrated. I'm going with, you probably saw this one coming. I'm going with overrated. Now look, first of all, I get it. Obviously having a very durable truck is super useful. Of course. But bulletproof up to 9mm rounds. Yeah, I'm not going to test that. But you know, there are some other YouTubers out there who totally will. And apparently it can literally stop smaller rounds without being punctured. But also the glass windows aren't bulletproof. They're more of just stronger than regular glass. And then it's regular wheels, regular tires that can still get slashed. So don't go getting any ideas that this thing is invincible or anything like that. But clearly, cold-rolled stainless steel alloy is going to be much stronger than the regular outside of the vehicle. So that's the shopping cart in the back of the parking lot. That's fender benders. Or if someone hits you, you'll be fine. You'll be fine. But guess what? It also means your truck is now made of an extremely fingerprinting material. And it also doesn't have normal door handles. So you just cannot keep it clean if you use this thing daily. And then steel just happens to be really hard to manipulate. Apparently Tesla had to create new machines strong enough to stamp this material together. There's a reason why there aren't a bunch of other cars rolling around looking like this. So when I say in the autofocus review that low-vin cybertrucks will have low-vin production issues, that's not actually new to Tesla. They've to spin up manufacturing for different types of vehicles before. And usually the first few thousand of them aren't pretty. But then they learn from those issues. And then one or two years down the road, they're making millions of the thing and they're much better quality control. So this particular cybertruck is the dual motor all-wheel drive. This was borrowed from Ridge. Shout out to Ridge, by the way. I'll leave a link below if you aren't caught up on my partnership with them. But on delivery, this one had a pretty big panel gap on the driver side door. And you know, I never really care about panel gaps, but this one in particular actually started growing and getting worse. It literally looked like the door was open. And then it started making weird noises while closing. Until one day, it actually broke. So it turns out it wasn't a panel gap. It was actually a manufacturing issue where the bolts that hold this latch in place were actually not torqued tight enough and they loosened over time and it fell out. And so miles actually had the bright idea to just gaff tape the latch securely back in place. And now when you close the door, lines up perfectly. So Elon Musk addressed this on Twitter after my video. Apparently only 15 trucks had this issue. So lucky me, I guess. So if you are one of the few, then you can apparently just take this to a Tesla service center and they'll be able to fix it in no time as long as you get an appointment. The cyber beast that I took delivery of under my name has been flawless so far. But I think the point I'm trying to make is these early cyber trucks as with any other early Tesla, they're going to find I guarantee more issues like this and they'll work on them and fix them. But yeah, this foundation series badge right here kind of clouded in the Tesla community because it basically means you got one of the first few. But it also kind of means willing baited tester in a way. So you know, these materials and this new stamping technique and all this should eventually make the vehicles much easier to produce in mass and cheaper. But that's eventually eventually. All right, next feature truck stuff. I'm talking about the theoretical reasons why someone would logically buy a truck over any other vehicle like a van or an SUV or a car that would be for towing, hauling and off-roading. And I know it looks like this truck would be amazing at all of that stuff. But I'm going to say that this one it's overrated. It's overrated here and I'll tell you why. And don't get me wrong. The cyber truck? Very capable. It's much more capable than any other Tesla obviously. I can confirm it handles winter weather really well. Like it has heated windshield wiper and the heated mirrors and the door can in fact open and icy weather. They added a wade mode that lifts the suspension all the way up and pressurizes the battery so that you can drive through really deep water. It's insane. And it also has off-road driving modes and towing modes right here in the settings. There's also only one wheel entire option right now with cyber truck. Every single cyber truck ships with the same good year territory Wrangler RT tire. Whatever. It's a pretty popular tire and they ship them on you know Jeep Grand Cherokee's and F-150's all the time. And it's reinforced and it's capable of some light off-roading. But I think if we're being honest most people will be driving this thing mostly on the street like a glorified SUV. So here's a number to think about. 63. 63 is the percent of truck drivers who admit to rarely or never towing anything at all. And that's just the ones that admit it. Like look at this chart. This is from a survey of F-150 owners. So the most popular truck in the country. People are almost never actually towing with these things. So before we leave the comment that this thing sucks for towing. Yeah they know. We know everyone buying it kind of should already know if you're buying a truck specifically for towing then you have a short list of trucks you're considering and none of them are electric. But I think my main realization with this thing is there are millions of Priors for this thing right now because it's Tesla it's going to be very popular. This is going to be a lot of people's first truck and it will come with all of the first truck realizations. Like to a lot of people the cyber truck looks absolutely huge but it's actually smaller than an F-150. And these people when they get the truck they'll think they're invincible and they can drive off road and just go wherever they want without even thinking about strategically going certain routes or airing down the tires that literally come at 50 psi from the factory. They're going to start getting stuck in all sorts of embarrassing situations which means of course then there will be countless articles written about them because of course no other truck has ever been stuck in the snow before. And it's just sorry I'm definitely getting ahead of myself but look we will be using a cyber truck at our video production studio for a lot of the same reasons that we've used in R1T. It's got a tow hitch. It's spacious. It hauls a lot of gear. It's quick. It's quiet. It's great. But I think the point I'm trying to make is most of the millions of people who will end up with these cyber trucks eventually are going to use them on the street just like a glorified SUV just because they think this one looks cool. And that's fine. All right next category performance. Overrated or underrated. Well you might have seen this little video that Tesla did on their YouTube channel racing the cyber truck against a portion 9.11 while towing a 9.11 and beating that 9.11 and that that was a very clever video. It's an ad of course but it also takes advantage of the fact that EVs all have this commoditization of this enormous straight line performance. Great acceleration. Anyone can get it but you know I'd normally never compare a pickup truck to a sports car right but well we're here. So like most drag races this one was just for fun but while we have some time at this drag strip we did a bunch of these we did back to back to back races and it shed a lot of light on Tesla's video and on the cyber truck in general. So first of all EVs are quick right we've known this for years ludicrous mode then plaid mode beast mode this is not new information but cars with gears can be faster so that's there's a difference between quick and fast so when you go to a real drag strip with timing equipment and all that stuff you get one of these after. There's a time slip breaks down in both lanes not just the end of the quarter mile but multiple points along the race and so I've expanded it here so this was the triple motor cyber trucks best run one of the first runs it runs a 10.9 second quarter mile which if you don't know is absolutely ridiculous there are bona fide sports cars that don't run in the tens and for a 7000 pound pickup truck to do it on all terrain tires is just kind of hilarious but when you actually look at and break down each of these times this shows the difference between quick and fast so first of all off the launch just from zero miles an hour the cyber beast with its triple motors and with its thousand hertz traction control managing slip at the rear wheels basically in real time is able to explode off the line through the first 60 feet of the race faster than the 911 Turbo S one of the fastest launching cars ever made now from there it holds that lead continues putting down all this power all the way out to 330 feet so you can see that at 330 feet 4.4 versus 4.5 it's still out ahead but by the time you get to 660 feet which is roughly halfway through the race that's when the 911 has changed gears twice and continues to pull and this is when it shifts and passes the truck around halfway through the race physics just takes over and the lighter car with many more gears continues to shift it passes the truck crazy enough the cyber truck hits its 114 mile an hour electronically limited top speed probably because of the tires well before the end of the quarter mile while my child I mean the car continues to pull into the 140s no it's not stock now Tesla made this video that I talked about and they wanted to showcase the cyber beast against a Porsche 911 and they know all of this so they had to get clever I'll say so if you haven't seen it I'll link it below their video shows the cyber truck pulling up to the line it's racing a Porsche 911 it beats the 911 in a drag race and then it's revealed that it was towing a 911 the whole time so they're saying you can beat one while towing one and then it flashes the quarter mile time on the screen 11 seconds so first of all there's about 50 different models and variations of the Porsche 911 so just based on what we saw and from the performance in the video I'm gonna guess that they went with the cheapest and slow as possible 911 so it would be the 911 Carrera T it's a manual transmission it does 0-60 in around 4.3 seconds so now the cyber truck with its 2.6 seconds 0-60 has a massive advantage and so they're able to handicap it by having it tow the 911 like 3000 pounds okay so then they run the race and if you watch the video they run it out to this yellow mark right here which it turns out is actually the halfway point of the drag strip so shout out to engineering explain for doing the math on this I'll leave the video below but it turns out the Carrera T thanks to its gearbox is still eventually faster than a cyber truck especially if it's towing 3000 pounds but it's really an eighth mile race that they're showcasing here and then they quote the quarter mile time at the end as if they ran a quarter mile race but as we've learned today quick fast people will point out that difference but I'll let it slide it's just a drag race it's fun it's not that huge a deal but I will say if you can from stoplight to stoplight be just as quick as basically any other car in a 7000 pound truck that's incredible that's hilarious that's really fun but hopefully at least now you understand why I'm saying performance is a bit overrated it's more of a one trick pony in a straight line now that one trick is very fun and very appealing to certain people there are people every day who pick the F-150 wrapped or over the F-150 for stuff like this but you know then you get to a turn and it's a truck again but also one more thing I just want to highlight again in our best run we got 10.995 seconds in the cyber truck is this the fastest is this the world record for fastest cyber truck quarter mile I haven't seen any faster so let me know if you do but shout out to miles a driver mod I think we might have a world record here all right the 800 volt architecture and the 48 volt low voltage system both new to the cyber truck I'm going underrated if only for the fun fact that this this is technically the lightest fully electric pickup truck in the world which is not the highest bar to clear but yes thanks to the lesser wire weight it is lighter than the Hummer EV it's also lighter than the F-150 lightning and it is lighter than the dramatically smaller Rivian R1T so that's an accomplishment I was also hoping it would charge like just as faster faster than other Teslas but it seems right in line you know 250 kilowatts at V3 super charges for about the first third of the curve you know it looks like less as far as miles per hour that you're adding to the battery but that's including driving efficiency which is thanks to the aerodynamics of a refrigerator not great now I also want to give shout out specifically to this suspension just the suspension on the cyber truck which I think is underrated first of all there's a huge amount of travel between the lowest and firmest and the highest and softest settings and no one's gonna say this thing drives like a sports car but it is pretty impressively low in firm in its lowest setting and it's very high and it can move between those low and high settings really quickly and I was also very impressed by how a little roll and yaw there was typically a big truck you hit accelerate and the nose comes up a lot this one goes up a little not bad but then also we got to talk about just for a second Teslas minimalism because it's a kind of a staple of Teslas at this point especially with the cyber truck here with the design but also on the inside and with materials and the choices they make I think a lot of us would agree that a physical button in a lot of ways is better than a digital button I don't think that's a hot take but one of the reasons Tesla has been so successful business-wise over the past couple of years in such a competitive market is because they figured out a way to make a profit on every vehicle and they minimize all of the extra pieces all of the moving parts and they've gotten rid of a lot of buttons actually they've gotten rid of basically every button in the cyber truck but because of Tesla's success I feel like auto manufacturers have started to copy a lot of what Tesla does to the detriment of some of their vehicles I would have liked to have seen in the cyber truck this big special vehicle maybe a cool key fob that has access to a button to open the front truck or maybe real climate control buttons or maybe we all know they should have done a mirror that's actually a screen so you could see out the back of the truck without looking down at the screen but they didn't do that so I'm saying Tesla's minimalism kind of overrated here but I also do need you to know that despite all the other interesting technical stuff that I've talked about in this video this is still a Tesla under the hood and all of the things that we love about that and all the other stuff that comes with it that means it works with Tesla superchargers all over the country that also means it has a super heavy 123 kilowatt hour battery in the floor it means that the quiet interior of the vehicle makes the speaker system sound way better than it probably should and it also means a bunch of things are missing about these early trucks as they deliver them the super heavy additional range extender battery in the back isn't shipping yet and nobody knows when it will the screen also has no car play or android auto but the software is really good and super fast but there's also no autopilot right now even if you paid for it no light bar right now even if you paid for it no arrow caps right now and you did pay for those the locking differential at the rear axle doesn't work in the dual motor version of this truck yet and there's only one tire option for a truck all of these are decisions that Tesla makes knowing the priorities of the probable buyers the millions of pre-orders of the cyber truck they know what people are probably going to do with these they know what people think they're going to do with these and they know what people want when they buy one of these things it's a Tesla under the hood so I was driving to the suit of the other day and on my way there I'm coming up over this hill and on the other side of the hill is a spiker across the street and as I came over the hill he looked up and he saw the truck for about two seconds and then he reached out and he just did this as he as he bike passed me but later that same night I was on my way home from practice around the bridge somewhere in New York City at night and slowing down in traffic this car pulls up next to me kind of in front of me and all four of the windows roll down and these super happy faces all stick out and just like give me thumbs up and they're grinning the entire time and say that's about the ratio of joy to absolute disgust that you bring into the world driving the cyber truck around it's probably like 80-20 so what's a verdict with the cyber truck right I think there's a lot going on between those four corners a lot of interesting choices and materials and technologies and steer by wire and 800 volt systems and all this stuff but a lot of it frankly is overshadowed by the design again so we keep coming back to the design and I feel like we can use that word again iconic I would say as a product person I do think this is already an iconic design now that comes with a lot of baggage I feel like when you say that word it's kind of like joining the rare air of like the the bedroom poster of some on some kids wall it's like the Lamborghini Cuntosh or the Bugatti Veron or something like a Tesla cyber truck but the thing about those iconic cars is they're also almost always rare and that's the things like if you saw a Bugatti Veron on the street that's probably the only Bugatti Veron you're going to see on the street for a long time there's not that many Lamborghini Cuntosh is out on the world now the cyber truck today is super rare and there's all these articles about you know celebrities driving them around and when you see one it's an event that's why people are reacting the way they are it's probably because it's the first time they're ever seeing one but the cyber truck is slotted to be mass produced so I feel like this actually has to wear off after a while like obviously it hits different seeing your 10th or 50th or 100th cyber truck of the day right so how how does that match up I think there's like two million plus pre-orders of the cyber truck and more coming there were only ever about 2000 Lamborghini Cuntosh is ever made there's less than 500 Bugatti Verons ever made so it's kind of hard to find a comp for a vehicle that starts off its life as iconic but then is mass produced and there was this really interesting comment on the autofocus video I made about this truck on owning the PT cruiser when it first came out and I wasn't really old enough to remember this so I'm purely taking their word for it but apparently it was a crazy enough design that it got a lot of attention when it first started being made you know it's a weird shape had some odd material choices and all that but eventually Chrysler made over a million PT cruisers but now we know exactly how cool the PT cruiser is you know it gets humanized more and more the more you see them on the road you see them get an accident and have to maneuver through traffic and they're just regular people and regular cars and they're everywhere and I guess the question is is that the arc for the Tesla Cybertruck like we don't know but it has to go from being this crazy unobtainium that it is right now to being something only time will tell thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace"
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,Here's the Thing about the M3 Macbook Air...,HN-WH7C4K0Q,2024-03-20T21:20:58Z,PT9M19S,3912542,103164,5438,"['Macbook', 'Macbook Air', 'Macbook Air M3', 'M3 Macbook Air', 'review', 'M3 vs', 'M3 Macbook Air vs', 'MKBHD']"," That's crazy that the most interesting things about this new laptop are the reasons not to buy it. So the MacBook Air just got refreshed. It's a pretty simple update. Maybe a boring one actually. There's really only two things new. It has this new anodization on the outside, apparently a slightly more fingerprint resistant look to it and it has the new M3 chip inside. So the coding, I don't know. It barely makes a difference if I'm being honest. It still gets fingerprints if you handle it regularly without a skin or a case. I would much rather depend on something like a skin from Channel Sponsor D brand. It lets you break out from one of the three really simple colors and it's going to hide fingerprints a million times better than any metal treatment ever could. Plus, these are real leather. So they have a nice plush texture and it'll patina over time. So I'll leave a link to this one below. But the other new thing is this M3 chip inside. So we've seen this M3 chip before. This is what Apple does. They put the same chip everywhere. This came out in October of last year and they immediately put it in the new iMac. And then we also got a new MacBook Pro that launched with this and the M3 Pro and the M3 Max. So okay, new M3, Apple Silicon third generation. Great. So now we're finally getting this new base M3 chip in the new MacBook Air. Side note, why does it take so long? I don't know. It feels like Apple kind of staggers it probably on purpose, but like it's the same chip everywhere. They've done the iMac. They've done the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. But the Mac Mini just staying on M2 kind of weird. Also the new iPad Pro still on M2. When is that going to get it? Anyway, you already know that the MacBook Air is the most popular Mac for a reason. This is the base entry level Mac that most people are seeing as the way to get into the Mac world. And so the base MacBook Air has typically been one of the easiest to recommend laptops in the world by design. But this one interestingly for two reasons isn't. Now this has nothing to do with performance of M3 or anything weird like that. Like it's the performance you were expecting. If you look at benchmarks, it's right around that 10 to 20% improvement over M2, depending on what you're doing. Definitely Leanne's heavier on graphics improvements this generation. And there's the ray tracing now finally. So any applications or rendering that are taking advantage of that, that's going to be a noticeable improvement for M3. And it's clearly a more capable chip. And also MacBook Air is especially the 15 inch just constantly get great battery life across the board. You also get now dual external display support with the lid closed, but one external display with the laptop open. And it also appears that the base storage on M3 is much improved. So this was one of those concerns from if you look back at M2, you know, obviously Apple seeds reviewers with higher end MacBooks. So most of us aren't getting that. But if you look back at M2, the base 256-yeq model used a single SSD module instead of two SSDs. Long story short, that storage module was way slower than M1, like 50% slower on paper. Would you have noticed if nobody told you and it never benchmarked it? Maybe possibly not, but obviously it's a bummer having way slower storage on a new M2 and that extra time transferring large files that adds up over time. So I'm happy to report that I've seen really good benchmarks on the base storage of the M3 Air. It appears that they fixed it. Awesome. So what's the deal with this M3 Air then? Why am I saying it's not necessarily the best recommendation? Well, historically MacBook Air has been super easy to recommend, but with this M3, they also lowered the price of M2 by 100 bucks and discontinued the M1. So now the lineup is M3 MacBook Air starts at 1099, then M2 MacBook Air starts at 999, and then M1, it's kind of gone from Apple, but you can still find stock that's left at like Walmart or Best Buy. Now the thing about the MacBook Air being easy to recommend is we're talking about regular people, which it's very light, regular, normal usage like web browsing, listening to music, a bunch of tabs open, work stuff, occasionally compiling or rendering some small things, photo editing, and chopping a video or two sometimes, but really very light. So these people, a type of people who would buy a laptop at Walmart would be totally fine with the cheaper, identical looking MacBook Air with the slightly slower M2 chip and slower storage. I think they would be totally fine. But the other thing which I need to talk about is this whole base spec thing. This is not exactly new to the industry, but the base price and the base spec has almost become like this weird fallacy. I think it was Linus who did a video about how starting at is like the biggest lie in tech, and he's right, it's not just tech, like the car industry does it all the time to starting at this super low price, but nobody actually gets it at that price. You're not going to get a totally bare base model car. The base price is really more to give you an idea of how much you're about to spend when you actually option it up the way you want to. And the issue with these is Apple's markup prices for above base spec is crazy high. Like Apple charges way too much for the most basic upgrades. Obviously Apple Silicon computers are all a system on a chip, so they cannot be upgraded ever after you buy them, right? So once you buy it, you know, you're kind of incentivized if you're going to keep it for a long time to splurge a little bit and give yourself some extra headroom and future proof it and bump up that spec. But Apple charges so much for bumping up that spec that the base price feels like kind of even more of a lie than usual. So the MacBook Air starts in 2024 again at eight gigs of shared RAM and 256 gigs of storage. Now, ignoring the fact that the phone I'm using also has more than eight gigs of RAM in 256 gigs of storage. If you want to upgrade to 16 gigs of memory, the first available RAM upgrade, that's $200. And if you want to bump up to just the half a terabyte of storage, that's another $200 more. Compared to how much that actually costs Apple, especially at the scale that they're operating, that is just crazy brutal ridiculous pricing. So even if you do just that, suddenly the MacBook Air M3 is $1,500. So either you're cool with knowing you're actually buying a $1,500 plus dollar MacBook Air or the real question is, is the base spec in 2024 actually usable? And my take is actually sometimes yes, sometimes yes. So again, if you're the people I talked about earlier, you're you're buying a laptop from the showcase at Walmart or Best Buy, you just needed to do the basic stuff I mentioned earlier. You actually can do that with eight gigs of shared memory, no problem. This might seem like a hot take, but I've spent a lot of time doing this stuff. You rarely actually get close to hitting the max and hitting memory swap. And even when you do, it's very much still fine. It's one you get into the heavier stuff like media encoding or exporting or gaming that it's a whole another story. So if you're watching this video, you already know which group of people you're in. So for that massive group of people who are doing a lot of that normal baseline computing stuff, don't buy the new M3 MacBook Air. You can very easily get an M2 MacBook Air and save your money. Matter of fact, if you don't need the brighter display, the mag safe, the external display support, which you probably don't at this rate, it's also a great idea to look into Best Buy or Walmart's like $6,700 M1 MacBook Airs that they're selling right now. I think Walmart first announced they would have it for $6.99 and then a few days later, Best Buy announced that they'd sell it for $6.49, which is pretty sick. So clearly, M3 is a much more capable overall chip and brings the floor of a laptop up. But the way I see it, what Apple Silicon has done to Apple's lineup is it's brought down the minimum level of machine that you can get away with doing your workflow. Does that make sense? Like me, I edit a lot of videos and so I need a powerful machine for Final Cut Pro and that sort of stuff. So for the longest time, I can only use an Apple desktop, the highest NIMAC Pro, the Mac Pro. And I still will, but I am now able to use Mac Studio and I can actually edit. I've had an M1 Mac MacBook Pro for a while and I've been editing on the go with a laptop, which is a huge like enabler for me. And the same sort of thing applies if you're doing like gaming stuff or if you have a whole bunch of coding and heavy, maybe even just encoding photos or whatever you're doing at that level, you typically rely on a MacBook Pro. But with these new chips and with Apple Silicon, you can do that on a high end MacBook Air, which is again, a pretty sweet enabler. So that's what the new M3 MacBook Air is. If you do that sort of stuff, it's an amazing computer. It should be on your short list, great all around, easy to recommend. But again, if you're doing the lightweight normal stuff and you need a MacBook Air, don't get this one. Get the cheaper one. Okay, that's it. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys the next one. Peace."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,Small Phones are Dead and We Killed Them,iR9zBsKELVs,2024-03-14T16:58:18Z,PT8M42S,3346131,125185,12776,"['small phones', 'small iPhones', 'MKBHD', 'zenfone', 'zenfone 11', 'zenfone 11 ultra']"," You know, if you've been watching my videos, you've noticed a certain sentence that I've been saying for years. I've been saying, small flagship phones are a rare breed. And I said that countless times over the years, but today, that's no longer true. That breed is now extinct. RIP to the small flagship phone. Okay, we don't even have to rewind that far to the days when phones were all smaller across the board. But then really quickly, we shot up to four inch screens, then five inch screens were popular, then six inch flagships were everywhere. We never quite got to seven inch phones being mainstream, but it seems like all of the biggest flagships now are teetering right around that. But the funny part is, smartphone manufacturers have had the same realization over and over again, which is that, oh, smartphone screens are getting bigger, and so there's room for the smaller alternative phone to slot in underneath that. So like I just reviewed every single Samsung Galaxy S ever, the year that they started to get really big, they of course also introduced a Galaxy S Mini. It's the most Samsung thing ever. But guess what, now that's dead. Same thing for Apple. We finally got huge iPhones, and then sure enough, we got an iPhone Mini for two years, but now that's dead too. And this kept happening and happening all over the place until there was basically just one good, small flagship phone left, the ASUS Zen phone. The rare breed. So this thing, the Zen phone nine came out in 2022 and was a nearly perfect flagship phone. Like seriously, flagship specs, incredible performance, physics defying battery life, like rock solid cameras. This phone won my small phone of the year by a landslide, even with the few tiny flaws it had, you know, the back material being a little less durable, and it didn't have wireless charging. So then in 2023, they came out with a sequel, the Zen phone 10, and that took a good thing, and basically perfected it. They fixed the back material, they gave it wireless charging, they upgraded it to the latest flagship chips, they didn't lose anything, nothing went wrong. It was just the singular, excellent flagship phone with a less than six inch screen in 2023. So now it's 2024, and the new Zen phone is a gigantic, 6.8 inch ultra phone. Now honestly, we probably should have seen this coming, right? When has a small flagship ever lasted more than a year or two, right? But it just, I don't know, it hits a little harder when this was the last small one. Like here's something to think about, right? I think Apple is, you could argue, one of the best supply chain companies in the world, right? That's how they built their business. That's how Tim Cook took the stock price from here to here. That's what they do. Tim Cook is a supply chain guy. So every time they come out with a new product or a range of products, they have to do the supply chain thing and figure out exactly how many they need to produce. So they have these complex studies and their ways of estimating how many they think will be sold of every single skew, and then that's how many they need to make. Not too many, just the perfect amount, perfect inventory management. That's the supply chain thing. That's Tim Cook's thing. So in 2020, for the first time, Apple decided to release a new lineup of four new iPhones. It was iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, the 12 Pro Max, and the 12 Mini. Of course, the 12 and the 12 Pro are the same size right in the middle. This nice little sweet spot of the lineup, and the 12 Pro Max, just being this absolute maxed out biggest screen, biggest price. But then the cheapest, most pocketable new iPhone in the lineup is this new little mini phone. Now Apple, Tim Cook, that all the supply chain knowledge and the studies they've put in, they already know small phones don't sell particularly well. So they make all of their changes and line up how many of each they're going to produce. And then they send it. They send it all into production. And you know, reviews, honestly, for the most part, were super positive. Across the board, people love the mini phone. Yes, the battery life is weaker on the smaller phone. But to put a flagship shape and a flagship chip and a flagship camera in a mini phone, it's just such a rare thing. So it was extremely well received. Tech reviewers love it. Real users are loving it. YouTube videos are loving on the thing. And the mini iPhone still sold dramatically less than what Apple had prepared for it to. There are some surveys that have the mini iPhone at like 5% of the total sales of the entire new iPhone 12 lineup. Sometimes even less. I mean, it was really, really unpopular in the grand scheme of things to actually buy an iPhone 12 mini. So suddenly it went from being the darling of the lineup to the least successful new iPhone of all time. And the headlines were all over this and sort of wondering if they would even try this again. And it did for one more year. They did an iPhone 13 mini. It did even worse than the 12 mini. And then it was quietly discontinued. And guess what was in its place? A brand new plus sized iPhone. Because of course. So the moral of the story is, the mini iPhone experiment reinforced what we already knew, which is not enough people actually buy small phones to be worth it for a company, even of Apple size, to put in all the research and development to keep making these things. Like some people think, oh, this thing is getting positive reviews. So it must be a success, not always true. And also the counter, if things are getting negative reviews from YouTubers that must be why it died, also not always true. So now here we go with the Zenphone. Now here's the thing. Not to discount the Zenphone 11 Ultra, it's actually a really good phone. In fact, it's a perfectly fine, large flagship phone. It brings all the good things about Zenphone 10 to a bigger scale, bigger battery, awesome battery life, the latest chips and specs again, lightweight software and smooth performance, rock solid cameras. It actually added a third telephoto camera. So it's all here. It just loses the biggest thing, or I guess the smallest thing, that really made it different. Just the fact that it was actually small and reachable from corner to corner, and didn't require huge pockets or huge hands to comfortably daily it, all of that is gone. And now it's just like a ROG phone minus the gamer stuff. Actually, seriously, that's basically what it is. This is the new Zenphone next to the new ROG phone. If you take away the screen on the back, the 165 Hertz display, the side USB-C port, the shoulder triggers, honestly it's basically the same phone. So this Zenphone just feels like it's blending into the sea of other giant phones. If I was guessing, Zenphone 9 and Zenphone 10, despite how much we love them, didn't sell very well. And so they moved on kind of the same way that iPhone 12 mini and 13 mini didn't sell particularly well. The last part of that equation, the fun fact is, even today, the most popular new iPhone is still the Pro and Pro Max, the super high-end biggest phone. And so what did Asus do? They made a super high-end big phone. Now to be perfectly super clear, Asus technically hasn't confirmed that they're not going to make a regular Zenphone 11, but the body language suggests that this is the only one. They just sort of rename it the way Apple just stopped making the mini and started making a plus. We just assumed the mini's gone. So there's no solution to this. It's right in line with the enthusiast phone dilemma. Whenever a phone manufacturer comes along and starts making an enthusiast phone, it gathers a really, really hot audience for that specific device, but it's small. And so when they end up trying to branch out and make it more successful, they lose the core fans. And I don't know if this info is going to lose the core fans, but people who liked it for being small certainly aren't going to like this one anymore. And this even applies to budget phones too. Small budget phones are getting bigger. Pixel 7a is a 6.1 inch phone. The nothing phone two-way that just came out is literally an ultra sized phone. And rumors of the next iPhone SE also point to that being not small. So the void is now open. So it might come along and make another small flagship phone to briefly fill that void, but don't expect it to last too long. RIP, the small flagship phone. RIP, the small flagship phone."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,Nothing Phone 2A Review: Flashy Good Deal!,VdOlqcg9uMQ,2024-03-05T12:28:28Z,PT12M21S,2645713,90689,4135,," Budget phones are fun because pretty much with all of them, if you poke around hard enough, you will find the thing that they had to cut corners on. You'll find the thing that they trimmed back to get it to be a budget phone. And so for picking one for you, it's just a matter of picking the one that makes the trade-offs that you're okay with. Like, maybe you love, you gotta have good build quality and cameras. Well, then iPhone SE is probably a good one for you. And then you know you're not going to get a great screen or battery life or things like that. Maybe you gotta have a great big screen. Samsung makes Galaxy A54, or maybe you gotta have good software and cameras. Pixel 7a. This phone is $350. And this is the designer one. So this phone is not going to win anyone over with raw specs. It's not going to win by having the best camera or the best battery life of any budget phone. The performance isn't going to blow you out of the water, but you could definitely argue that it's the prettiest $350 phone. So nothing has had this transparent aesthetic going for a while with their phones and then also the earbuds. This one definitely also has that. There's also a white version of this. I think it looks better. It also has like black buttons, so it's kind of this nice contrast. But you know, dark version looks cool too. And honestly, if the mission is to look like a nothing phone and not be mistaken for anything else, then yeah, mission definitely accomplished. The dual cameras in the middle near the top is pretty unique, kind of like a pair of eyes maybe. And the NFC coil actually surrounds the cameras. Then there are three bars of LEDs making a glyph design around the camera circle again. Then it's kind of this split design. The bottom half is like a PCB inspired look, apparently inspired by the New York City subway map. Nothing's already shown people this. Like there's been some reactions to the design already. Some people love it. Some people actually hate it. I don't know. It's a bit asymmetrical, so it's unconventional for sure. But I think it's nice. Not going to lie. But even if you don't like it, at least you can say it's at least somewhat visually interesting. You know, there's some textures. There's some exposed screws and some text and that little red square. It's not functional. It's just purely to look cool. So I appreciate that. And if you do like this look, but have maybe a more boring phone that you're not willing to give up, then Channel sponsor Dbrand has you covered with their something skins. So if you haven't heard of it already, Dbrand has performed some, and these are their words, not mine, creative plagiarism on nothing's whole design language, both in light mode and dark mode. So I'll leave a link below if you want to check those out. But guess what? It's an extremely competitive price bracket. So you get a good looking phone, but you still will have to make some sacrifices to get it. So first of all, it's clear plastic, not glass at the back, which, you know, I'm sure Zach will get to this phone at some point, but I think it'll be easier to scuff and scratch, but harder to shatter like glass would be. So, but I think it's a reasonable trade off. It's also a textured plastic frame as well. So it looks like aluminum, but it's this plastic all the way around the phone to the point where this phone actually ends up feeling surprisingly light in the hand for how big it is. But we should, we should just get to that. This is a huge, is a jumbo size phone. It's gigantic. Some people might not love that, but I think a lot of people like really big screens. And you get the natural advantages that come with a big phone, which is a big battery and a big screen. So this is a relatively giant 6.7 inch display corner to corner. It's, it's literally ultra phone size. And it gets pretty bright too. So definitely not flagship bright because we have some crazy numbers these days, but 1300 nits peak brightness is very visible and bright indoor lighting and bezels are even all the way around the front of the phone. So aesthetically, I have no complaints. And then even at this price, it's ammo led. It has an optical fingerprint reader under the glass. It's variable refresh rate up to 120 hertz and it even has 2160 hertz PWM dimming. So if you don't like the back of this phone, at least the front of it that you're actually looking at all the time is pretty impressive for 350 bucks. But I'd say an even bigger strength of this phone is battery life. So battery always comes from like three main things basically, obviously having a huge physical battery, also good software and an efficient ship. We'll get to the software. But this phone has a 5,000 milliamp hour battery. That's literally bigger than their flagship phones from nothing. So really big battery. It doesn't have wireless charging, but it does have 45 watt wired charging, which is pretty good. That's zero to full in an hour. And the chip it's running is this little thing called the media tech, DEMENCITY 7200 pro. So this was my biggest question mark actually going into testing this phone because you know how nothing teases the specs and stuff ahead of time. So we find out it's immediate tech ship. And I'm not sure if this one's going to perform the way I've been used to some other phones, like they're showcasing all these, you know, specifically handpicked benchmarks results. Of course they will, but conveniently they only compare it to a two year old nothing phone one, which had that mid range 778G plus from Qualcomm. Now I'm not expecting flagship stuff for 350 bucks, but like what's it going to land at? This feels like a maker break part of the phone. And I've been pleasantly surprised. Now it's not going to win any prizes with the raw specs. And I definitely don't think it'll earn anybody's money with the benchmark scores alone. You look at those numbers. You're like, okay, not a total shock here, but as far as actual performance when you use the phone, the way I put it is it's respectable. And I really feel like that is a testament to the software and how well it's working together. So at this point, we're on nothing OS 2.5 on top of Android 14. You already have seen nothing phone software with the dots and the aesthetic and all that stuff, but it's clean. There's no bloatware. And there is a solid focus on fast and smooth. It kind of feels like a like a throwback to the old OnePlus magic back in the day. But with regular use, this phone is quite smooth and snappy. Sometimes the fingerprint reader shudders a little bit like when you're first unlocking, but for the most part, if you're just using the phone, doing stuff like messaging or flipping through a couple apps, email, web browsing, taking your pictures, this is a smooth phone. It's pretty similar to what they did with the nothing phone one with the 7.78. It's very solid with everyday use. And the second you try to do super high-end stuff like gaming, then you'll see where the benchmarks come up short, where you start dropping frames and all that. But again, this is a $350 phone and I am definitely not complaining about that. And nothing has had some time now to build up their aesthetic and their identity and what they really want a nothing phone to be. And I gotta say, they have a lot of unique, really identifiable things going on here that you may like or dislike, but they're all here. So aesthetically, they've got the dots everywhere. So the stock apps have this dots aesthetic and the thin font to go with it. The back arrow in Android is made of these dots. And they have this extensive built out selection of nothing widgets now. Most of them with the dots theme as well. So you can have this very consistent home screen aesthetic. And then there's other little stuff like you can enlarge a single app icon to fill up four spots on your home screen for a unique home screen grid. I don't know, you might be into that. There's also this nice little animation with the folders on the home screen. Also this new thing which lets you add a glass effect to your wallpaper so it's blurred behind your home screen for better visibility. Actually, really like that. There's also AI wallpapers now. So you can jump into the wallpaper studio and create the most soulless combo art the world has ever seen in just a few taps. There's also third party icon pack support on the home screen with instant one touch previews. And then of course, the glyphs. So this phone still has some lights on the back. It's less lights in the flagship than the phone two, but about the same amount of functionality. There's one vertical light on the right and a small one down here on the bottom left. And then the big top one, arcing around the top left. This is the one that works with the glyph countdown timer. Maybe you'll find that useful. The blinking notification glyph when your phone is down. I still wish I could just customize it a little bit more. I know they don't want to do RGB, but if this was RGB, I would totally have different colors light up for different app notifications and I would go to town with that. But you know, it still works, which is white lights. And it also does music visualizations to sync up with any music coming out of the speaker. So I don't know. It sure. Obviously some of this stuff is gimmicks. Some of this you may find useful like once or twice. I almost never use the countdown clock, but the one time I use it, it's kind of cool. Side note, I couldn't get the glyph composer to work at all on this phone. The UI worked, but it didn't light up the lights on the back. But you know, on super close up photos, maybe the glyph fill flash is decently useful sometimes useless other times. But hey, while we're on the subject, the camera, the cameras on the back here are serviceable. Like it's just practical to have cameras on the back of your phone and these, they're not good, but they're fine. I always feel like we go into budget phone reviews, kind of knowing, okay, this isn't going to have cameras that blow me away. It's not going to be as interesting to test these, but you got to test them anyway and see what they're made of. So this has a different new 50 megapixel primary camera on the back and then it has the same ultra wide camera as the nothing phone to and actually also the same selfie camera. And look, it can take okay pictures, all right, passable pictures. I know 50 megapixels is a big number, but here's what I'll say at this level, even in great lighting, the photos aren't particularly sharp. The dynamic range or depth of field aren't amazing. Like you're not buying this phone to take the greatest most artistic photos and videos the world has ever seen. But what you do need is for it to be serviceable, to be quick enough for autofocus to work, for it to capture a moment, document scanning, video calls, sharing photos with people. And it does all that and it's totally fine and I can't complain. And really what's left a bigger imprint on me using this is that compared to their other flagship phones, almost all of the features are still here. But the only one I'm not actually seeing on this budget version of the phone is macro mode. And that, that theme of keeping a lot of the stuff from the more expensive phones and not doing these like artificial cuts, that's what feels good about this phone as a budget phone to me. It actually feels like they're trying to give people all of the nothing phone experience for less money. Now, we definitely can't say it's one to one. There's obviously cuts, especially with hardware like there's no wireless charging like I said, it's IP 54 instead of IP68. It's plastic instead of glass and aluminum. But I like that once you start to get to use the phone, especially with the software features, experience wise, I don't feel nearly as many artificial feeling cuts as we've seen on other phones. Like there's no pro mode in the camera that's missing from the budget phone. All the same advanced settings, the experimental features, all the home screen features with nothing OS. It's all here on this cheaper phone. And the crazy part to me is like they obviously want to compare this to a lower end phone. So they compare it to the phone one and my natural instinct is like, I'm ignoring that. Of course they're comparing it to the old phone. But when you actually look at that two year old phone, you kind of see how far they've come and you look at the things that are actually better about this budget phone. This nothing phone 2A has a bigger brighter screen with thinner bezels. It has a larger battery with faster charging, a higher processor clock speed, a higher resolution front camera, and a wider variety of refresh rates than the phone one. No wonder they want to show us the phone one. But in general, if you're looking for the TLDW, yes, this is a good solid all around budget phone. And the way nothing has been tracking with software, it appears, I mean, they're promising three years of Android updates with this phone. I think this will be a good budget phone to own for the next couple of years. Well done nothing. Well done. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys the next one. Peace."
Marques Brownlee,UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ,Reviewing EVERY Samsung Galaxy S Ever!,eKVTFXQPAhs,2024-03-02T01:23:30Z,PT43M49S,3643687,123594,10923,"['every Galaxy S', 'Galaxy S', 'mkbhd', 'MKBHD', 'Every Galaxy S', 'reviewing every Galaxy S', 'Every Galaxy S review', 'Galaxy S24', 'Galaxy vs', 'Galaxy S vs', 'Galaxy S24 vs', 'Galaxy S25', 'Galaxy S1', 'Galaxy S1 vs', 'history of Samsung']"," Samsung Galaxy S. One of the most popular names in the world of smartphones and has been for years, interestingly, is kind of a long name. You might be wondering where Galaxy S comes from, and if you think you already know what you're thinking is probably wrong. Apparently, Galaxy comes from a wine often enjoyed by high-level Samsung executives, and then they proceeded to name like 20,000 phones after it. Now, here's the thing. Samsung will try anything. That's kind of their thing. Like, this is something I've known about them for a long time from reviewing their phones, but just from researching for this video, like they have a ton of phones in every single imaginable price bracket or feature set or spec sheet. Here, you can even try to guess these. They've had a Samsung Galaxy F series. What do you think the F stands for? Sands for fun. Then there's the Galaxy Z series, Z for zero, and Galaxy M is, you think, mid-range, but it actually stands for millennial. And then Galaxy A, that's some of the most popular affordable smartphones, so naturally it stands for alpha. There's Galaxy W for wonder, Galaxy R for Royal. The list goes on. But then the flagship that's lived at the top of their lineup is the Samsung Galaxy S. And S stands for Super Smart. Yeah, Super Smart. Anyway, the first ever Samsung Galaxy S comes out in 2010, just to set the scene. Like, this is three years after the first ever iPhones come out. So the iPhone 4 is about to come out. This is a couple months after the Nexus 1 gets unveiled. Blackberry is quaking in their boots. Like, the entire smartphone industry, if you want to call it that, is totally in a reshuffling. Things are up for grabs. And it's still very much in its infancy, too. The second most popular phone selling by volume looks like this. It's a Nokia 3720 classic. And so Samsung launches the first ever Galaxy S, Super Smart, into the world with over two dozen variations. It's going to be a bit of a theme here. You know, it was a pretty basic phone. Big touchscreen on the front, some capacitive buttons, a plastic removable back, a single camera. Today, we have Samsung Galaxy S24, and it's ultra-refined, tightly packed, supercomputer in the palm of your hands with high resolution cameras and displays, powerful processors, AI features, like just a ton of optimizations that have stacked up over the years to get to this point. So today, I've got every single Samsung Galaxy S that has ever been released. They're all in front of me. Actually, it's every main Galaxy S variant from the S1 to the S24, everything in between. And I'm going to review them all. And some of them I've reviewed before and others are like the first time I've ever gotten them working on camera. But either way, it'll be fun to go back and go through. This is the story of how we got to where we are today and where it started. So buckle up. We're going to jump right in. Also, stay tuned for the graphs at the end. Like usual, they're super fun. So Samsung Galaxy S, this is the first one, summer 2010. And yet, it does clearly look old with the classic four-capacitive buttons at the bottom, Android 2.1, and it's a micro USB port at the top next to the headphone jack. But I feel like right off the bat, you can see Samsung differentiating itself here. First of all, this is a reasonable display. This is a four-inch screen and it's a Samsung made AMOLED display. So that's a huge deal. Back in these days, you could see a meaningful difference in battery life, just if you set a wallpaper with a bunch of black in it. Because the pixels didn't have to light up on the OLED, and that was a new concept back then. It's also only a 1,500 million bar battery, so every bit of savings you can get means a lot. Also, of course, this was back in the day when you could just pop the back off any phone and just take the battery out, swap it out at any moment, have two batteries if you want to, swap them in and out real quick while the others are charging. We will witness the death of this feature during this video. But then using this phone now, like, okay, it feels slow, obviously, but it's not really in the laggy or unresponsive way, it's just slow. Like, there's a lot of solid waiting for anything to happen, especially heavier stuff like the web browser or opening the camera. You just have to slow down a little bit, give it a second, even though this launched with what at the time was the fastest graphics processing of any smartphone, thanks to a Samsung made chip inside. Oh, and speaking of cameras, it launched with a single 5 megapixel camera on the back, which was capable of shooting actually 720p video right out the box. It asks for a memory card to do a lot of things like shooting videos, because it only comes with two or four gigs of storage out the box. But there's a microSD card expandable storage slot in the back of the phone, so you could go right up to 32 gigs right off the bat. So I never used one of these phones, but my favorite thing about it now is it it's kind of got the modern shape already. It has like kind of flat sides and a flat back. There is no camera bump. There is a small bump in the plastic actually over the rear-facing speaker, because it was common to put your phone down on a table or something and without that bump, it would block the speaker. And so that bump literally is just to keep the speaker open so you can always hear your sound. Now you remember how I was saying, Samsung will kind of just try anything. That's been true since the first one. Like this first-ever Galaxy S launched with like I said, over a dozen variants. And so you might recognize this one as the Samsung Galaxy S stratosphere. And you can tell because this is the one with a little Verizon stamp on its forehead here. But you might have had the Samsung Galaxy S vibrant. That's what it would be called if you got the variant that was made for T-Mobile. Or the Samsung Galaxy S Epic 4G, which is what they call the one that launched on sprint. Now in hindsight honestly, it feels like this was Samsung's way of just getting around carrier exclusives because they basically just made a slightly different version of this phone for every carrier in America with a little bit of a different design and a little bit of different features. Only Samsung. Only Samsung. Little did they know this would be the beginning of a whole empire. So the sequel, the first sequel is the Samsung Galaxy S2. Second gen can teach you a lot. So right away a couple things. This phone is notably bigger and noticeably sleeker than the first Galaxy S. And these are back in the days where the percentage increases year-to-year with some of the stuff they did was crazy on paper. Like this one from a one gigahertz chip to a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core chip. So that's just more than double the processing power. It also went from a 4-inch screen to a 4.3-inch screen. It goes from a 5 megapixel 720p camera to an 8 megapixel camera on the back shooting 1080p. It doubled the RAM up to a gigabyte. It bumped up to a 1,650 milliamp hour battery. And the amount of bass storage, I guess you would say, octoppled from two gigs all the way up to 16. And it did all that in a phone that got thinner. And it also added NFC. So it added pieces and now this is an 8.5-millimeter phone. So this is one of the thinnest phones in the world at the time that it came out. Now the starting price also did go up a lot from 3.99 to 5.49. But this phone did launch into a relative success. This sold like 3 million units in the first two months. This was definitely the first one to show up on my radar. I never owned one of these phones. But I definitely saw it and thought about it. But then this next one, the Galaxy S3 in 2012. This is the first Samsung Galaxy S that I actually owned. And I remember loving this thing. I remember it well too. The jump up in size again was very real, so it's all the way up to a 4.8-inch phone now. Which believe it or not, like this is starting to push the limits of what people considered an appropriate phone size. Because I remember around this time, there are a lot of phones that were hitting exactly 4.65 inches. Like that was a popular phone screen size for the big phones at the time. And anything near 5 inches kind of felt like weird, like a tablet size. And here's Samsung's flagship pushing 4.8 inches of screen. And then the four capacitive buttons down at the front are now just three buttons. The search button's gone. So it's a home button. That's a physical button with back button on the right and menu on the left. And this is also the first time we got a voice assistant on the phone. And they called it S voice. Clever. I know. This is a pretty direct response to we just got Siri announced on the iPhone the year before. But you know, S voice, S for Samsung. They also use S for a bunch of other stuff. S notes. So Samsung voice, S voice. Now S voice wasn't good. But then again, neither were any of the other voices assistants that were coming out. So this is mostly just people poking around, asking it to do things random facts, just whether things like that would turn out to be much more significant with this phone is just this super sleek design. The whole thing is shaped like a thin pebble that you could probably skip across a lake. It's inspired by nature. The whole OS leaned into that. It had a ton of water droplet sounds everywhere. The lock screen went from swipe to unlock to dragging your finger through this water. Like it was a pretty strong theme for them. But I remember using this phone and reviewing it. This is back in college for me. I loved it. It was also received very well. And the combo of like being super slim and fast and having a huge OLED and S voice had it starting to get touted like the iPhone killer. But I think more interestingly, they thought this phone was big enough to warrant an S3 mini. Because this is a 4.8 inch screen, like I said, kind of giant. And so they came out with a one with a 4 inch display Galaxy S3 mini at the same time. Because of course they did. But the next year we got Samsung Galaxy S4, which was the beginning of a lot of things. But I don't think the fourth generation of any major new product is like the defining one. This one's no exception. Now of course, they're still making gigantic leaps on paper with specs. Because these little pocket computers are getting more and more capable of everything they do. So it goes from a 4.8 inch 720p screen to being one of the first phones with a 5 inch 1080p screen. In the age of a bunch of new retina displays that are aiming for the best pixel density. Then they also had variants all the way up from 1.4 to 1.9 gigahertz dual-core processors. It again doubled the RAM from one to two gigabytes. And that single back camera went from 8 megapixels to 13 megapixels. So this is the first time you could take 1080p videos from the camera on the Galaxy S and then watch them on the 1080p screen on the front of the Galaxy S. Pretty sick. This also goes from a 2,000 milliamp hour battery to a 2600 milliamp hour battery. Still removable. A 30% increase is pretty crazy. But again, they just keep aiming for one day of battery life. That's been a theme since this long ago. Like yes, these things get more and more powerful every year and they're doing more and more stuff. But as long as they can hit one day of battery life, they seem cool with that. Now if you want more proof of Samsung just trying a ton of things, this phone had a ton of random features. Some of them actually are kind of interesting because they feel like the AI features of back in this day. So like this is the phone that tried head tracking smart scrolling. So when you're reading something, you can tilt your head forward and backward to scroll through the page. It's insane. It had smart rotation. So this is actually cool if you have auto rotate on, but you're looking at the screen while reading something and then turn sideways, it won't rotate the screen. It'll keep it right side up. Smart pause is fun. You're watching a video. You look away from the screen. It'll automatically pause. You look back. It'll play again. So there's lots of stuff like this. Some of it sticks. Some of it doesn't find. But this was also partially used to justify another increase in price for this phone. So S4 at launch, I don't know if you remember this, it launched at $650. This is also the first time Samsung made an active version of the phone. So another variant. So Galaxy S4, Galaxy S4 active. So this added IP67 certification and a more rugged design. It was a TFT LCD display instead of AMOLED and it traded some other small dongrades for like physical buttons and a slightly thicker phone with some flaps to cover the ports. I'll tell you what was not really a major hit though. This is one of the first major incidents of a Samsung phone battery swelling, catching fire and burning up on someone. Now it didn't go happen to a ton of people. It wasn't enough to become a major trend, but it's something to sort of remember for the future foreshadowing. Now by the time we get to Galaxy S5, Samsung is starting to hit their stride I think with the Galaxy S. Another huge battery bump. Now it's up to 2800 million hours and another huge screen bump all the way up to 5.1 inches diagonally. And across the board, this is a I think fully flagship in every dimension. It's a 2.7 gigahertz processor on some variants. Alright, 2 to 3 gigs of RAM, up to 32 gigs of storage and it's a 16 megapixel camera that now shoots 4k video. Also the bottom left button has gone from a menu button to a multitasking button to match the three primary buttons needed to operate Android, but also says a lot about what it's capable of. But then of course alongside all that is the absolute classic Samsung just trying things. And I think the telltale sign for this stuff is when you see them try it for one generation just to throw it out the wall and see what sticks and then it's gone the next year. Like they added this little sensor back here next to the camera flash on the back. That's a heart rate sensor. So you can measure your heart rate plugs into s health. That didn't last very long. They also added this weird texture for the first time to this plastic back that you know made it a little softer yes, but also totally made it look like a band-aid plus it even came in this flesh color that also didn't stick around long. They also added a fingerprint reader to the home button. Fun fact back in these days you actually had to swipe your whole finger across the home button to get it read. Of course fingerprint readers have stuck around, but it doesn't have to be swiped anymore, so that's improved significantly. And you can see this weird port at the bottom here. The Galaxy S5 has a sort of a double port. Basically it could be used as just normal micro USB for charging, but if you wanted full USB 3.0 data speeds there was a special like double ended cable you could plug in to use all the pins and get that kind of weird that didn't stick around long either. Also there is a flap on the bottom of all these phones for water resistance and they were super easy to fall off. And this one also fell off. Naturally they also released both an active and a separate sport version of this phone alongside the regular Galaxy S5. Of course they did. So Samsung Galaxy S6 came out in 2015, but truthfully this was the beginning of a new era for Samsung phones. You can look at it and see it. This is when they entered the modern age for better for worse. So this phone was the first one with a fully glass back instead of plastic, which yes made it their first non-emvable back. QLV Outrage in the comments of every YouTube video at the time, but it also added wireless charging and they dropped these metal rails and metal buttons on the sides that felt way more solid than all the plastic we were working with on all the flagships that came before it. And this phone is sleek. Like footprint wise it's literally the same size as an iPhone 15 Pro from today, but turn it sideways and it's one of the slimmest phones ever thanks to having a 25 50 milliamp hour battery. Yes, that's actually smaller than the previous year. Now this is a recipe to make enthusiasts particularly mad when you go backwards. It's not great. So they heard that this went from a 2800 to a 2500 milliamp battery and it's not removable anymore. And it also no longer has the microSD card for expansion of your storage. And on top of that you also went from that weird USB 3.0 down technically to USB 2.0. But aside from that, this still did feel like their first really modern piece of hardware. This is also the first time we're getting a 1440p AMOLED display. It's crazy sharp already. We haven't seen a higher resolution since then. And it's also the first Galaxy S flagship with optical image stabilization in the primary camera. So this is a really big camera upgrade and it was the first Galaxy S flagship to use 64-bit processing. I do remember there was a lot of positive reception around this phone obviously from being well put together and meddling glass now and having good features and just generally being the same price as a previous year. I just feel like there was one thing holding it back especially among us critical reviewers from being the obvious best Android phone available at that time. And her name was TouchWiz. See around this time there were also some other big enthusiast Android options like Nexus 6P and 5X which were stock Android. And then there was HTC 1M9 just down the street with their own HTC software, LGG4 was out with their own software. And so like every Android device seen at this time when it comes out it's like what are the specs, what are the features, what's the design, and then what is the Android skin that you have to deal with to get it. Now TouchWiz has gotten better over time. It's you know a little less bloop nature sounds but it's still absolutely a skin on top of Android rather than super integrated into Android itself which can make performance feel a little slow. It can slow down how quickly updates come to this phone over time because they've got to go through Samsung but it gives you a bunch of extra features in return. So at the time if you go back if you watch my videos around the phones at this time I always preferred like stock Android OEM just straight from Google it's always the fastest updates and it just felt the cleanest and most coherent where Samsung TouchWiz just had this colorful cartoony look to it this feel to it is a little cluttered but it had the features it had what mattered. Anyway with S6 they also tried a little thing called the S6 Edge and Edge Plus because there was this war being fought at the time every time you saw a keynote with a new smartphone announcement they always mentioned the screen to body ratios and so every flagship if they can improve the best number they would always brag about the screen to body ratio how thin their bezels are and the best phones at the time were hovering around 70% meaning 70% of the front of the device is screen and the bigger that number the cooler the phone looks so this S6 Edge thing came along and it's another bit of Samsung innovation just trying some stuff but they literally bend the OLED display right over to the edges of the phone and use curved glass to make it look like the display is like bleeding right over the edges of the device hence the edge name obviously there's still a bezel but it kind of worked it looked really cool this actually came at first from when they originally tried it in the galaxy note which they had it on one side of the screen which is some like software tickers they literally put like a stock ticker on the side of the phone they would try anything to see if it worked and when it did they put it on both halves and now it's on the galaxy s and it felt like the flagship thing so this phone got up to a 76% screen to body ratio with the S6 Edge Plus this is starting to feel like the top of a flagship lineup now galaxy s7 was a kind of an incremental year in between you know holding it now you can tell they didn't really feel the need to change too much like it's the same size same screens and resolutions same storage sizes up to 128 gigs and they actually brought back expandable storage by popular demand so I guess you can talk Samsung into some stuff and you still can't take the back off this thing but they went ahead and added a micro SD card slot on the SIM card tray which is clever but what I feel like they really realized this year is two things one wow you can really shove a lot of batteries in these things and two the edge is the flagship people love the edge people just love the screen melting over the sides things so they're going to do a lot more of it so the regular s7 was great but the s7 edge had a 3000 milliamp hour battery and the s7 edge plus had a 3600 milliamp hour battery and then the s7 active had a 4000 milliamp hour battery but for reference this is also the same year that the galaxy note seven came out so you may recall the issues that plagued the phone and its 3500 milliamp hour battery the exact issue the reason why the note sevens started blowing up and having dangerous battery problems was specifically a design issue using a thin separator between two electrodes in a battery it was just damaged way too easily where wild reactions would occur when that damage happened for as many gates as we've had for smartphones like bend gate whatever this has to be the greatest PR disaster in the history of smartphones I think by a long way like people this got banned on planes like people would just ask do you have a Samsung phone like I don't think you want to take that on the plane it was literally recalled worldwide they took all of them back they couldn't sell it anymore it's a big issue and honestly a lot of tech companies would never recover from that but Samsung at this point was established enough they were big enough they were trying enough new things that they could weather that storm then Samsung Galaxy S8 this is one of my favorite phones they added a lot of things to this phone now still classic Samsung thrown an absolute metric ton of stuff at the wall to see what sticks now I definitely didn't love all of the stuff that they tried but I love that they were trying stuff and they tried so many things that these phones just feel a world apart so first of all there was an S8 and an S8 plus and both have fully curved edge displays so Samsung's realized that this advantage is received really really well and they can just keep touting their massive screen to body ratios plus they've refined their edge screen apps feature it's subtle it's out of the way but it's useful for those who want to take advantage of it then they also tried this new pressure sensitive layer underneath the display right around the home button so the display can always respond to pressures in this area no matter where you are even while the screen is off now this is also as you may have guessed right around the time that Apple was trying 3D touch or force touch in the iPhone and both of these didn't last very long but they tried and they also tried a slightly taller now or 18.5x9 aspect ratio which actually did nicely keep the ever growing screen size to be pretty reachable since they've also gone from capacitive buttons below the screen to all on screen buttons so now talk about screen to body ratio like we are really cooking they also switched to USB-C for the first time sick easy win people were asked for that last year anyway but then with that they also tried this thing called decks which is like if you plug that USB-C port into a computer monitor you get this whole computer UI which just uses the phone as like a trackpad and then you might have noticed the extra button here on the left hand side so fun fact for the entire history of every single Samsung Galaxy S so far they have always had power button on the right hand side volume rocker on the left hand side and that's still true here but they've added a button underneath the volume rocker and yeah that's that's the bixby button so bixby is the new voice assistant replacing s voice on Samsung phones and Samsung really leaned in hard with this one so not only did it get a dedicated button to activate it all the time but the camera also now has bixby vision which is kind of like an awkwardly specific competitor to google lens and this is Samsung really leaning into the whole AI assistant thing for the first time and I would say mixed success then they also tried a fingerprint reader on the back of the phone this time since there's no home button anymore love that and then they also tried this this plastic snap on keyboard which I think honestly might be in my top five worst smartphone accessories of all time but even after all of that I think the most important or the most impactful decision for this phone for Galaxy S8 was their choice to use Qualcomm Snapdragon chips in some regions and Samsung's own made exynos chips in other regions now at the time or even in hindsight this was a pretty smart move maybe even ahead of their time because this is Samsung going all right we want to make our own chips for our phones so that we can maximize the efficiencies and all the the power and the things that we do in our phones we want them to all be built by us and also to not give Qualcomm so much money but also in hindsight this failed spectacularly this was like an ongoing thing they really wanted to do but because they didn't go all exynos right from the get go they split it they had some exynos and some snapdragon the snapdragon phones would consistently and regularly outperform the exynos version of the same phone across the board better performance better efficiency better battery better heat it literally got to the point where prospective buyers would jump into subreddits and forums to try to find where they could import a Qualcomm version of the phone instead of the exynos one available in their own country and there are a whole bunch of tutorials on if you're buying a secondhand one how do you know which version you're getting just based on the serial number just so you can avoid the exynos version like I said in hindsight ahead of their time a bit here but big backfire nevertheless there was lots of other stuff that was so new about this phone had just to fight another increase in price all the way up to seven hundred and fifty dollars that's today's prices so galaxy s nine i'm gonna say this was peak samsung galaxy s i loved this galaxy s nine and again it was galaxy s nine and s nine plus now this was a relatively incremental update versus s eight but you know slightly thinner bezels same ram same storage but a slightly improved processor nice colors i like these colors and then they also move that fingerprint sensor on the back from right next to the camera to right under the camera otherwise you know what basically the same thing but then they had to try some stuff so this time they tried this dual aperture thing with the camera and it was super cool basically it could snap between f one point five wide open and f two point four a variable aperture and a smartphone it's a clever little thing that would let me receive as much light as possible in low light situations but when you have plenty of light it would stop down to two point four and it would get more in focus it would be a sharper better looking photo and i remember i loved it when i used it other reviewers loved it when they used it and then it was gone from the next phone samsung we missed this bring it back but honestly this is one of those phones picking it up now like i've talked about this before if you could bring back any old phone design from whatever year and just modernize it with new specs and new software i think between htc one m eight or m nine and this phone pretty good candidate this this thing is sleek it's just a great size it's a 1440 p o led usb type c still has a headphone jack obviously the fingerprint reader is in a good spot just a really great overall package and i said as much in my original review back in 2018 now is it still samsung software yeah but at this point there are so many features jammed in here that it's kind of undeniable the utility and yet people are totally willing to live with it as long as you know what you're getting into with a samsung phone fun fact this is also the year that samsung unveiled the galaxy home a small weber grille shaped speaker designed to be an ai assistant in your house with bixby it's been about two thousand days since that announcement no word on it since then i don't think it's officially been canceled maybe they just want us to forget about that one so then samsung graduates to the galaxy s 10 this i think could be argued also maybe as peak samsung since they've now basically just gone full screen to the point where reviews are complaining about the last few millimeters of forehead and chin like you see how the chin is just a tiny bit bigger but yeah up at the top we've gone right up to the earpiece and the selfie camera is now a cutout in the top right hand corner giving birth to a whole new genre of meme wallpapers screen to body ratio is approaching 90% now and we're basically just looking at samsung's best in class 1440 p.m. led and not much else and now these phones have gotten irreversibly big s 10 has a 6.1 inch display and the s 10 plus would be 6.4 borderline tablets with size 10 years removed from the original but truly entering us into the modern age this is the first samsung phone with more than one camera on the back and in samsung fashion they just jump straight to three obviously so there's a primary camera a 2x telephoto camera and a 0.5 x ultra wide phones would never look the same after this point every phone up until now so far has had just that tiny little camera bump just a single little circle or oval on the back but as soon as you open this box you're never going back cameras are now a feature on the back of a phone and you'll also notice there's no fingerprint reader on the back of this phone because this is also the first one that they tried that ultrasonic fingerprint reader underneath the display glass and it's pretty much nailed it right from the get to I remember testing it and seeing if it will work under water and if it was scratched at all it was fine it haven't really improved in much since these days so it seems like they nailed it they still use it but the thing that maybe brought this phone the most into the age of modern smartphones might just be the price so samsung's been throwing a ton of stuff at the wall for years and now they've just built out this whole lineup but s10 starts at nine hundred dollars when it comes out and then they have the s10 plus which starts at a thousand they also had an s10 5g which was an even bigger even more expensive version of the phone with a bigger battery to support you know 5g radios because 5g is sort of burgeoning at this time expensive phones I think that actually is why one of my favorite new releases around this time was this little new thing they made called the s10e and this thing you know it's not quite a mini but this is where samsung made a couple little corner cutting decisions to separate the true flagship from something a little more budget friendly so for seven hundred fifty dollars it has slightly smaller and slower charging battery and a power button fingerprint reader instead of the ultrasonic underscreen one but honestly probably a better deal than the flagship said it was up against so now on to the next one galaxy s20 and no we didn't skip any phones here basically 2020 is the year samsung decided that they were going to sync up the year of the calendar with the year of the phone so we have s20 in 2020 I'm sure that has nothing to do with the fact that the number was always slightly behind the flagship iPhone but now this galaxy s20 looks blank boring soulless what happened like this feels like this is a complete blank phone like if you put the s10 next to the s20 and then not to jump too far forward but the s21 it looks like they took a year off with the s20 like this might be the most generic phone of all time not to be fair there are other phones that have looked like this and again this is samsung's flagship four years and we know they're gonna start to play it safe but in hindsight this one is pretty dull it also happens to be the first ever galaxy s since the very beginning to move the volume rocker to the right side that's a choice it also is the first one to not say the model number on the back at all with the text it's just blank and it's also the first galaxy s to follow in the footsteps of the iPhone after making fun of them and removing the headphone jack also a choice now I do love that this was officially the first galaxy s flagship with 120 hertz display and they actually moved the smaller hole punch camera to the top middle and it was the first to be able to record 8k video so it's still gaining capabilities it's not like the ball didn't move forward at all with this phone but probably the more interesting dynamic is what was happening at the very top of the lineup see this is the first year of the ultra phone so s20 still a regular size phone thousand dollar phone but they also decided to make a gigantic phone with the most possible numbers and the highest and possible specs and make it an ultra and this was kind of fighting at the top of the lineup with the galaxy note because up until this point you know they tried a whole bunch of stuff and they ended up having this particularly successful high-end phone with a stylus in it that was if you wanted even more than the s could offer you could go buy a galaxy note so this phone in this year kind of just like its design just kind of got forgotten until later in the year when they dropped the fan edition the fe of the exact same phone cut a couple things down 1080p remove like one or two features 700 bucks and this phone was a great deal this one my phone of the year but also fun not so fun fact this galaxy s20 is also started swelling like the battery is started to bulge to the point where it's pushing the back of the phone off of the chassis through the glue so i'll just say i've had a lot of smartphones come through the studio we review a lot of phones obviously and we've had basically a large sample size of smartphones in long-term storage and the only brand that's had more than one smartphone whose battery swells up like a balloon to the point where we have to get rid of it is Samsung but then the year was 2021 and Samsung drops galaxy s21 definitely bringing us up to the current design language that is so recognizable as a Samsung phone so this triple camera is now in the corner of the back it's unmistakable now in fact this might be their best one with the metal piece melting over the sides and specifically this purple and gold colorway i think it's kind of iconic this is also the beginning of the base models being extremely boring i'm going now like the the actions way higher and lower in the lineup like the note fighting the ultra for supremacy that's crazy also the fan edition and the a-series kind of fighting each other to be the best overall value but sitting in the middle kind of a no man's land that just can't mess anything up and has to play it safe well that's exactly what the s21 did they actually bumped down to a 1080p display they're back to flat displays now no more expandable storage in this model no more charger in the box for this model whatever the industry is doing that's what they're doing like there's no leadership here there's just and just enough brand cache a that like if they make a Samsung version of the phone that everyone's buying in stores and put it next to that in the store people will just buy the Samsung one so galaxy s22 is more along the same track slightly more boring colors slightly flatter edges all the way around but on the upside this thing also does basically have perfectly thin bezels all the way around at this point so i think the screen to buy the ratio now is well into the 90s and frankly i don't even care what the number is anymore i just feel like there's so little bezel to hold with my fingers that anything less wouldn't really make any sense so the bezels effectively gone at this point it makes perfect sense to go back to the perfectly flat displays because Samsung has now realized and everyone else has realized that those curved displays they're kind of cool and they looked cool in the past but they were kind of a crutch to make the phone appear to have a larger screen to buy the ratio than it actually did but now that we have the tech to go right up to the edges in the corners you don't have to curve the display anymore it just looks sick and is flatter and is more durable so actually maybe the most notable change on the outside here is these phones are now slightly smaller than the previous year so one from 6.2 and 6.7 inches to 6.1 and 6.6 inches for s22 and s22 plus and there is no doubt in my mind that that is specifically to give more room and a bigger gap to the ultra phone at the top of the lineup the ultra has been doing battle with the note it's winning it stole the s pen from it and so with these boring default base phones for 750 bucks flat totally fine just just look up there though there's some more expensive phones you can spend more money so the Galaxy S23 was interesting for one reason and one reason only no more exynos version so every single Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S23 plus and S23 ultra ships with the same slightly customized Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 4 Galaxy and yeah performance is great you know for all the years that they've been trying to catch up the exynos chip to the Snapdragon chip they finally gave up on it which you could argue is good news because everyone now gets the good Snapdragon performance and efficiency now but it's also kind of bad news because there's less competition there's that much less incentive for Qualcomm to do anything particularly great here the whole goal for exynos chips was supposed to be better customization and integration and while we got rid of that they can still claim with s23 to have done at least some customization because they've like I said they've made it a four galaxy chip so it's not quite the off the shelf one everyone else gets what's different slightly higher clock speeds slightly more powerful because they've got better cooling in these phones so mission accomplished aside from that they've removed even more character by getting rid of the signature camera bump and making an even more generic and universal appeal phone than ever before just same set of cameras same aspect ratio same features just slightly more battery in both versions nobody saying these phones are bad they're just not making exciting strides the way they used to back in the day which brings us to this year's Samsung Galaxy S24 even more boring colors and even more generic design and even more playing it safe than ever before this year it's a snapdragon 8 gen 3 and this chip enables some pretty substantial AI features which they lean into it makes the phones really good stuff like live translation and generative photo editing call screening and my personal favorite circle to search is awesome but a lot of the AI features are now making their way to some other phones and circle to search isn't an exclusive the pixel has that too and frankly aside from just getting flatter edges and slightly bigger batteries they share a lot of parts with the previous year's phones like the cameras the screen resolutions they bumped up a little bit but functionally the same screen to body ratios the same maybe the buttons are clickier maybe that's enough these phones are all grown up now so now we've seen the glow up the different errors the plastic to the glass the iconic to the static but my favorite way to visualize all these different types of improvements is the graphs so welcome to my favorite section the graph section now before we jump fully in a quick word from our channel sponsor Dbrand fun fact they've been supporting these devices since the galaxy s4 that is a long time now they're also supporting all the way up to galaxy s24 and I think this year with these phones a lot of us were expecting to get cheat to support to get kind of like that ring of magsave style magnets but for whatever reason the stars didn't align so this phone doesn't have that but with the brand's cases for the s24 series they all come with magnets built in so that means basically any cheat to or magsave accessories will work on the s24 so they essentially give you that easy alignment on any wireless charger pretty sick you can check it out at the link below in the description so let's take a look at how far these phones have come these are really interesting and there's a couple of them I think Samsung is the first one that has notable ups and downs in their progress graphs which is really interesting it kind of feels like they're going backwards but there's a reason behind all of it also this could be a way crazier graph because they obviously split out and fork into a bunch of different models the edge models the plus models the ultra models the active models but I'm just sticking with just the base models just for pure simplicity of visuals so first up screen sizes so these are the screen sizes of the base Samsung Galaxy S over every single year starting at the original four inch Samsung Galaxy S then really quickly jumping up into the fives and then kind of slowing down and settling in right around six inches you can actually see a slight dip where the s10 was 6.1 inches then it was 6.2 again then back to 6.1 to make room for the ultra then back up to 6.2 again feels like now there's a sort of a dedicated gigantic phone so this rate of growth has pretty much evened out so the huge phone is the ultra which is 6.8 inches which is crazy but here's a fun fact based on this chart maybe it's not a fact but you can make an argument that the Galaxy S20 was kind of peak Samsung because that is the same screen size as today's base phone but hold that thought let's look now at battery sizes so you know battery life hasn't really improved dramatically we're still at a day for a good phone but the physical capacity of these batteries able to fit in these phones has improved significantly as well so you can see it starts at 1500 milliamp hours removable of course and nearly doubles by the Galaxy S5 but then it dips right when they introduce the edge phones then they shoot back up again but again kind of flatlines in line with a certain memorable battery related event but then they eventually got the courage to walk back up the base phone all the way to 4000 milliamp hours and what do you know again you can argue Galaxy S20 is peak Samsung that's the first year of the 4000 milliamp hour battery and that is still the battery size again now the primary camera megapixel count this one's a little more interesting maybe a little more classic improvement over time of course megapixels don't mean everything but it's fun to see the priorities increase over time at the beginning there was a lot of incentive to just level up from 720p to 1080p video and then to 4k video but once we hit 8k you know there's not any reason to go too crazy with megapixels beyond that of course the highest end ultra phones quickly blasted the ceiling way up all the way to 100 megapixels and then 200 this year which is nuts but for the baseline phone you know most people screens aren't 50 megapixels so I think this is a very appropriate plateau but then last but not least starting price we all know what happened with smartphones over the years and here you can see it visualized the steep climb through 400 500 600 bucks right up to the 900 dollar ceiling for the base Galaxy S this is the base phone now the most expensive phone has of course gotten dramatically more expensive too so again that ceiling lifting with the ultra has allowed Samsung to go way up to 1300 dollars starting and today you can pay 1660 for the one terabyte Galaxy S24 ultra but that has at least helped bump the base price back down a little bit to the 799 of today so that's how we got from here to here from Galaxy S1 to S24 these videos are super fun to sort of look back and actually visualize that progress over time I also feel like I already know which one we want to do next get subscribed make sure you see that coming up either way thanks for watching catch you as the next one peace from two gigs of I deserve that"
